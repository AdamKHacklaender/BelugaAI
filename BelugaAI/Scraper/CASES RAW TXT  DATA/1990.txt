LORD JUSTICE GLIDEWELL: The  plaintiff, Mr. Gordon Kaye, is a well-known actor, the star of a popular television comedy series. This formed the basis of a stage show in which the plaintiff was appearing in January 1990. The show finished its run in London on 27th January 1990. Thereafter it was due to appear in Australia with the plaintiff in the lead.
Mr. Peter Froggatt is a theatrical agent and a personal friend of Mr. Kaye. Since Mr. Kaye is at present incapable of managing his own affairs, in this action Mr. Froggatt is his next friend.
On 25th January 1990 Mr. Kaye was driving his car on a road in London during a gale, when a piece of wood became detached from an advertisement hoarding, smashed through the windscreen of the plaintiff's car and struck him on the head. The plaintiff suffered severe injuries to his head and brain. He was taken to Charing Cross Hospital where he was on a life support machine for three days. He was then in intensive care, until on 2nd February he was moved into a private room, forming part of Ward G at the hospital.
It was apparent that there was intense interest amongst Mr. Kaye's fans, and consequently in many newspapers and in television, in Mr. Kaye's progress and condition. For fear that his recovery might be hindered if he had too many visitors, and to lessen the risk of infection, the hospital authorities placed notices at the entrance to the ward asking visitors to see a member of the staff before visiting. Mr. Froggatt agreed with the hospital authorities a list of people who might be permitted to visit Mr. Kaye, and this was pinned up outside his room. A similar notice to that outside the ward was pinned on the door of the room itself.
The first defendant is the editor, and the second defendant company is the publisher, of Sunday Sport, a weekly publication which Potter J., from whose decision this is an appeal, described as having "a lurid and sensational style". A copy of a recent edition of Sunday Sport which was put in evidence before us shows that many of the advertisements contained in it are for various forms of pornographic material. This indicates the readership it seeks to attract.
Until 13th February 1990 Mr. Kaye had not been interviewed since his accident by any representative of a newspaper or television programme. On that day, acting on Mr. Robertson's instructions, a journalist and a photographer from Sunday Sport went to Charing Cross Hospital and gained access to the corridor outside Ward G. They were not seen nor intercepted by any of the hospital staff. Ignoring the notices on the door to the ward and on the plaintiff's door, they entered the plaintiff's room. Mr. Kaye apparently agreed to talk to them and according to a transcript that we have heard of a taped record they made of what transpired, did not object to their photographing various cards and flowers in his room. In fact a number of photographs, both in colour and monochrome, were taken of the plaintiff himself showing the substantial scars to his head amongst other matters. The taking of the photographs involved the use of a flashlight.
After some time members of the nursing staff of the hospital learned what was happening. They attempted to persuade the journalist and the photographer to leave, but without success. Security staff were called, and the representatives of Sunday Sport were ejected.
Medical evidence exhibited by Mr. Froggatt to his affidavit in this action says that Mr. Kaye was in no fit condition to be interviewed or to give any informed consent to be interviewed. The accuracy of this opinion is confirmed by the fact that approximately a quarter-of-an-hour after the representatives of Sunday Sport had left his room, Mr. Kaye had no recollection of the incident.
According to Mr. Robertson's affidavit, he regards what he and his staff had achieved as "A great old-fashioned scoop". He makes it clear in his affidavit that he realised that a number of newspapers were interested in interviewing and taking photographs of Mr. Kaye, and that some of them would "pay large sums of money for the privilege". He says, disingenuously, "I do not think it unreasonable to attempt a direct approach in order to get a free interview. The plaintiff only had to refuse".
The defendants made it clear that they intended to publish an article in Sunday Sport about the interview with the plaintiff, using one or more of the photographs that had been taken. A draft of the article as originally prepared is exhibited to Mr. Robertson's affidavit. It was intended to be in two parts, a front page lead with a banner headline and a full story inside the newspaper. The wording of both parts of the article made it clear that the defendants were saying that Mr. Kaye had agreed to be interviewed and to be photographed and described the interview and pictures as exclusive to Sunday Sport.
On Friday, 16th February 1990, upon Mr. Froggatt's undertaking by counsel to issue by noon on Monday, 19th February 1990 and serve on the defendants the writ in this action together with an undertaking in the usual form as to damages, Potter J. on an application made on behalf the plaintiff by Mr. Froggatt granted an injunction against the defendants in the following terms:
1.	 The Defendants and each of them whether by themselves, their servants or agents or otherwise be restrained from publishing, distributing, or causing to be published or distributed by any means howsoever or by otherwise exploiting:-]

LORD JUSTICE NEILL:  This is an appeal by Mr John Michael White from the order dated 10th April 1989 of His Honour Judge Lovegrove  sitting as an additional judge of the Queen's Bench Division.  By his order the judge dismissed Mr White's action for damages for personal injuries sustained by him at about midnight on 30th November 1984.  In the action Mr White alleges that his injuries and the consequential loss suffered by him were caused by a breach by the respondents, the Council of the City and District of St. Albans, of the duty owed to him under section 1 of the Occupiers' Liability Act 1984.  The 1984 Act came into force on 13th May 1984, only a few months before the events with which this appeal is concerned.  It was passed to amend the law as to the liability of persons as occupiers of premises for injury suffered by persons other than their visitors.]

LORD JUSTICE BELDAM:  The appellant, Andrew James Pitts, appeals against the judgment of His Honour Judge Fallon sitting as a Judge of the High Court at Bristol on 1st December 1988.   The appellant claimed damages for personal injuries received when he was travelling as a pillion passenger on a motor cycle ridden by the deceased, Mark Hunt, which was in collision with a car driven by the second defendant on 10th September 1983.  The question of liability had been ordered to be tried as a preliminary issue.  Having heard evidence on Wednesday 26th to Friday 28th October 1988, the learned judge dismissed the appellant's case against both defendants.  From his dismissal of the claim against the first defendants, the appellant now appeals.]

LORD JUSTICE BINGHAM:  In this action the plaintiffs ("the Club") sued the defendants ("the Council") for damages for breach of contract and common law negligence.   It was in issue between the parties whether there was any contract between them and whether the Council owed the Club any duty of care in tort.   These issues of liability came before His Honour Judge Jolly sitting as a judge of the Queen's Bench Division and he decided them both in favour of the Club (all questions of quantum being deferred).   The Council appeal, contending that the judge was wrong on each point.]

LORD JUSTICE PURCHAS: This appeal raises important issues concerning the assessment of damages "proportioned to the injury resulting from the death ... to the dependents respectively ..." (Section 3(1) Fatal Accidents Act 1976-"the 1976 Act") in the case of an infant dependant who has lost the support of his or her mother immediately following his birth. The claim, which is brought by Richard Brian Corbett ("Richard") through his father and next friend Brendan Desmond Corbett ("the father"), arises out of his mother's death for which the defendants, the Barking, Havering and Brentwood Health Authority admit responsibility in negligence. The assessment of the loss of dependency has been complicated by the immense delay between the death, which took place at a time when the infant was but a few weeks old, and the trial some eleven and a half years later. In these circumstances it is necessary to set out in summary form the relevant history. ]
