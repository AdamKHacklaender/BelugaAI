LORD JUSTICE CHADWICK:

This is an appeal from an order made on 1 July 1998 by Mr Justice Blackburne in proceedings brought by the appellant, Banner Homes Group Plc ("Banner"), in relation to a development site at White Waltham, Berkshire. The site was acquired, in November 1995, by the second respondent, Stowhelm Limited ("Stowhelm"). Stowhelm was then a wholly owned subsidiary of the first respondent, Luff Developments Limited ("Luff"). Banner's principal claim in the action was that, prior to the acquisition of the site by Stowhelm, an oral agreement had been made between Banner and Luff, for the acquisition and development of the site as a joint venture. The judge dismissed that claim; holding that there had been no concluded agreement. There is no appeal against that part of his decision. He dismissed, also, a claim in the alternative that, notwithstanding the absence of any concluded agreement, the circumstances in which the site was acquired by Stowhelm gave rise to a constructive trust in favour of Banner over one half of the shares in Stowhelm held by Luff. It is against the judge's dismissal of the constructive trust claim that Banner appeals to this Court. 
 

The primary facts
The judge's findings of primary fact  against which there is no appeal - may be summarised as follows:
 

(1)	At all material times prior to November 1995 the site, comprising some 6.8 acres was vested in M L Aviation Limited subject to an uncompleted contract with M L Holdings Plc ("MLH") as purchaser. The site was ripe for redevelopment and MLH wished to dispose of it.
 
(2)	Hewland Engineering Limited ("Hewland") was an interested purchaser for its own use and occupation; but only in respect of some two acres of the site. MLH wished to sell the site as a single lot to a single purchaser. In October 1994 Hewland was introduced to Luff as a prospective development partner. In January 1995 agents for Luff approached MLH on behalf of Luff and Hewland as co-purchasers with an offer for the site. The basis of the offer was subsequently modified to accommodate MLH's requirement that it would deal with a single purchaser, Luff, with Hewland becoming a sub-purchaser of the two acres in which it was interested.

(3)	The scale and nature of the purchase and subsequent redevelopment were such that Luff looked for a joint venture partner in relation to the balance of the site (some 4.8 acres) that would remain after the sub-sale to Hewland. In March 1995 Luff was introduced to Banner. Banner had, itself, known of and been interested in the site in 1994; but that interest had not been pursued at that time in the light of actual or perceived planning constraints. The introduction led to a meeting on 20 March 1995 between Mr Stuart Crossley, Banner's chairman and chief executive, and Mr Bob Pattison, a chartered surveyor who was employed as Luff's development manager. 
(4)	Immediately following that meeting: (a) Luff's agents wrote to the agents for MLH with a revised offer to purchase the whole site at a price of £3.4 million, subject to satisfactory detailed planning permission for the erection of a factory for occupation by Hewland and for the development of the remainder of the site as office accommodation; and (b) Mr Crossley wrote to Luff's agents, with a copy to Mr Pattison, confirming Banner's interest in a joint venture in which both parties would contribute equal equity and would share profits and losses equally. 

(5)	Mr Pattison replied to Mr Crossley on 3 April 1995. The letter included the following paragraphs:

The terms referred to in your letter  of 22nd March are in line with our own views on this scheme and should provide the basis for a mutually successful project.

We have looked at previous J V agreements we have entered into but on balance and following brief discussions with our legal advisors and Midland Bank plc, it would appear that the simplest solution may be the formation of a Joint Venture Company with each party holding 50% of the share capital. The company's Memorandum and Articles of Association will outline the agreement between the shareholders.

(6)	There was little further progress towards the acquisition of the site, or the proposed joint venture, until the end of June 1995. But, by the end of June, the price for the whole site had been agreed between agents for Luff and MLH at £3.4m (subject to contact) with the sub-sale of two acres to Hewland at a price of £1.2m. It was against that background that there was a further meeting between Mr Crossley and Mr Pattison on 14 July 1995. At that meeting there was agreement in principle as to matters recorded by Mr Crossley in a contemporaneous manuscript note. Those matters were: (a) that the site should be purchased from MLH at a price of £3.4m with a sub-sale to Hewland at £1.2m  leaving a balance of £2.2m to be funded by Luff and Banner as joint venturers; (b) that up to £100,000 would be spent on initial work, to include demolition, marketing, roads and any requirement imposed by the local authority; (c) that the purchase and initial work would be effected through a new single enterprise company to be acquired for the purpose and to be owned 50:50 by Luff and Banner; (d) that, at the end of nine months from the acquisition, unless Luff and Banner had reached agreement as to the development of that part of the site remaining after the sub-sale to Hewland, that remaining part of the site would be the subject of a "Texas shoot out" or disposed of on the open market at the best price that could be obtained. A "Texas shoot out" was understood to mean an arrangement under which either party could offer put and call options at a specified price or prices which the other could accept or refuse. 

(7)	On 20 July 1995 Mr Pattison wrote to Mr Crossley expressing the hope that a forthcoming meeting with Mr Peter Luff, his chairman, "will prove to be the start of a successful and profitable joint venture". On the same day Mr Pattison wrote to Mr Peter Vass, Luff's solicitor. The letter included the following paragraph:
We propose to form a 50/50 joint venture company with Banner Homes plc of [address] to acquire the above property [the White Waltham site] from M L Aviation at a figure of £3.4M. 

The letter went on to give Mr Vass the name of Banner's solicitor; and to inform him of the proposed sub-sale to Hewland.

(8)	The meeting with Mr Peter Luff took place, as arranged, on 24 July 1995. There was a brief discussion of the matters which had been agreed between Mr Crossley and Mr Pattison on 14 July. It was agreed that both Banner and Luff would instruct solicitors to prepare a written document. 

(9)	On 24 July 1995 Mr Vass wrote to Banner's solicitor "in connection with the proposed joint venture with Luff". He referred to "a purchase in the name of a newly formed limited company"; as to which, he said, he would be getting instructions in due course. Mr Vass received those instructions in the course of a telephone call from Mr Pattison on the following day. In his witness statement, which stood as his evidence in chief, he said this:


11.	In my file, dated 25th July 1995, is my hand written note of my telephone conversation with Robert Pattison of Luff. He instructed me to form a new company which was to be a single asset company just for this one project as they have done from time to time in the past. This could also be a suitable vehicle for the joint venture agreement. If there was a joint venture agreement the directors were eventually to be Stuart Crossley from Banner Homes and Peter Luff of Luff who was also to be the secretary.

 


12.	Accordingly I bought a company called Stowhelm Limited off the shelf.]

[
	LORD JUSTICE EVANS:  Lady Justice Hale will give the first judgment. 

 
	LADY JUSTICE HALE:  This is a claimant's appeal (with permission from Schiemann LJ) from the order of His Honour Judge Thompson QC made on 10th June 1999 in the Southampton County Court. The action arose out of a road traffic accident which took place on 29th February 1996. Proceedings were issued against the defendant, a Mr Brown, on 19th February 1999, just before the limitation period expired. A Defence was filed on 6th April 1999, claiming that the claimant had sued the wrong person. Mr Brown was the keeper of the vehicle and the policyholder, but his wife, Mrs Brown, was driving the car at the time. The defendant applied on 15th April 1999 for the claim to be struck out. The claimant applied on 17th May 1999 to join Mrs Brown as the second defendant. The learned judge granted the defendant's application and struck out the claim and refused the claimant's application. That, on the face of it, is, in the light of the circumstances of this case, a most unpalatable result. 

 
	The defendant's vehicle ran into the back of the claimant's vehicle which had stopped because a car ahead of her was waiting to turn right. Liability was never effectively in dispute. The claimant and Mr Brown exchanged particulars at the time. It is common ground that that exchange took place between the claimant and Mr Brown. It is the driver's obligation under the Road Traffic Act 1988 section 170(2) to give such particulars which should include his own name and address as well as the name of the owner and, under section 170(5), a certificate or evidence of insurance.

 
	As a result of this exchange the claimant informed her insurers, Direct Line. In her claim she named Mr Brown as the driver. On the 5th March 1996 Direct Line wrote to Mr Brown personally, as follows: 

 
"The information presented to us suggests that you were responsible ..." 
	and asking him to refer the matter to his insurers. On 16th March 1996 his insurers, Bradford-Pennine, wrote to Direct Line confirming that: 

 
"... for negotiation purposes liability will not be an issue." 
	The claimant also consulted solicitors. On 23rd April 1996 those solicitors wrote to Mr Brown personally as follows: 

 
"You are held wholly responsible for such loss, the accident having been caused by your negligent driving." 
	On the same day the solicitors wrote to his insurers, Bradford-Pennine: 

 
"Your insured is held wholly responsible for the said loss, the accident having been caused by negligent driving." 
	So it is quite clear at that stage whom the claimant, her insurers and her solicitors took to be the driver. 

 
	For my part, I do not see how references to the "driver of your insured's vehicle" in later letters from Direct Line to Bradford-Pennine, which are at best neutral, change that situation. No denials or clarifications were forthcoming, either from Mr Brown or from his insurers. It is clear from Mr and Mrs Brown's report to Bradford-Pennine (which is dated 5th March 1996) that they were both saying at that stage that Mrs Brown was the driver. Bradford-Pennine may therefore have known the position, but the claimant and her advisers certainly did not. 

 
	Thereafter there was correspondence between the claimant's solicitors and Bradford-Pennine on the basis that liability was not in dispute. Three interim payments were made; medical reports and statements were disclosed; an offer in settlement of general damages was made but rejected; further clarification of the special damage claim and loss of earnings was sought. On 3rd December 1998 the claimant's solicitors sent a schedule of special damage and supporting documents, and also said that the claimant's witness statement would follow shortly, as it did under cover of a letter of 17th December 1998. The letter of 3rd December had made it plain that the claimant's solicitors were aware that the limitation period was fast expiring. 

 
	A letter giving formal notice to Bradford-Pennine of the claimant's intention to proceed is dated 17th February 1999 and this asserted that the car was being driven by Mr Brown at the time. The first that the claimant knew that this was being disputed was, apparently, the defendant's solicitor's letter of 6th April 1999 enclosing a copy of the Defence and saying: 

 
"Liability for the accident is denied on behalf of Mr J McAlpine-Brown, since he was not driving at the time of the accident." 
	and suggesting that they discontinue the proceedings. Subsequently, witness statements were prepared from Mr Brown and his wife, saying that his wife was driving at the time. There was a witness statement from the claimant saying that she did not actually see the defendant driving before the accident, but she did see him get out of the driving seat. It was he with whom the conversations had taken place. It includes the words: 

 
"During our conversation the man did all the talking and wrote his details down on a piece of paper which he then gave to me. He gave his details as Mr J McAlpine-Brown of 2 Reeves Close, Draycot, Somerset. He also included the name of his insurance company which was Bradford-Pennine Insurance. I also gave him my details." 
	The claimant took the defendant, Mr Brown, to be the driver of the car which had run into her.

 
	The two applications, for a strike out and to add Mrs Brown as a party, were heard together. The judge did not hear oral evidence, but he did consider the factual issue as to who had been driving the car at the time. He held that all the direct evidence was to the effect that the defendant's wife had been driving: against that, he was only invited to draw an inference from the claimant's evidence that Mr Brown had been driving. Hence he concluded: 

 
"It seems to me quite clear, on the evidence which I have heard, that Mrs McAlpine-Brown was the driver." 
	That being so, the primary limitation period against Mrs Brown would have expired and so in order to make her a party he would have had to disapply it under section 33 of the Limitation Act 1980 before he could join her. He placed considerable reliance on the decision of this court in Howe v David Brown Tractors (Retail) Ltd [1991] 4 All ER 30. There was no application under section 33 of the 1980 Act before the court. He also indicated that an application to adjourn for that purpose had not been made: but in any case he would have refused such an application as it was wholly disproportionate to the value of this claim. The claim was outside the small claims track, but in his view undoubtedly within the fast-track limit. Therefore, in view of his decision as to who was the driver, if the claim could not be amended, it should be struck out. 

 
	In the course of his judgment he made the observation that: 

 
"What is so regrettable is that the proceedings were not incepted until the eleventh hour. If they had commenced earlier, this matter no doubt could and would, and certainly should, have been ironed out before the limitation period had expired, and all the problems that have arisen could have been avoided. But there it is: parties have three years in which to bring proceedings. If they choose to go to the wire, there is always the risk that they will be cut down by that wire." 
	As I said at the outset, in my view that result, in the circumstances which I have described, is a most unpalatable one. 

 
	What are the principles which apply on this appeal? One of the these applications (that is the defendant's application) was made before the Civil Procedure Rules came into force on 26th April 1999. The other one was made afterwards. Part 51 of those rules, and paragraph 15(3) of the Practice Direction associated with it, suggest that the principles of the Civil Procedure Rules should apply. It also appears that everyone in this case must have approached it on that basis, as will become apparent in a moment. There was, however, very little reference to the actual provisions of the rules in the judgment, and so it is possible to speculate (neither of the counsel who have appeared before us appeared below) that the judge himself was not referred to those provisions in detail. 

 
	The Civil Procedure Rules provide in Rule 1.1 that their overriding objective is to enable the court to deal with cases justly. Of course the question of proportionality comes into that question and the court's powers of active case management entail consideration of that issue. But again, for my part, to deprive a claimant of what on the face of it would otherwise be a cast iron claim, in circumstances such as those I have described, might not accord, it might be thought, with most people's sense of justice. 

 
	The first issue is whether the judge should have determined the question of the driver's identity summarily and, indeed, on paper evidence alone. The judge did not refer to the criteria for striking out a claim in the Civil Procedure Rules, rule 3.4(2). These allow the court to strike out a statement of case if it appears to the court: 

 
"(a) that the statement of case discloses no reasonable grounds for bringing or defending the claim; 
(b) that the statement of case is an abuse of the court's process or is otherwise likely to obstruct the justice disposal of the proceedings; or 
(c) that there has been a failure to comply with a rule, practice direction or court order." 
	The judge would not have been able to strike this claim out on those grounds, whether under the old rules or under the new. The essence of a strike out is that one does not look at the evidence on the claim. It is odd that the defendant's solicitors should have suggested this to the claimant. It also odd that they should have put into their application that the claimant knew the identity of the driver - which might of course have made it an abuse of process - when the only evidence for that assertion came from the Browns and does not appear in any communication or disclosure to the other side.

 
	Hence the learned judge could only dispose of the claim after a decision had been taken on the factual issue. It was, of course, open to him to decide that this was an issue which could be disposed of. He would be doing so, technically, not under a strike out application but under Part 24 of the Civil Procedure Rules which deals with summary judgment. For the first time it allows summary judgment to be given for the defendant as well as for the claimant. The grounds are set out in rule 24.2: 

 
"The court may give summary judgment against a claimant or defendant on the whole of a claim or on a particular issue if- 
(a) it considers that- 
(i) that claimant has no real prospect of succeeding on the claim or issue; ... and
...
(b) there is no other reason why the case or issue should be disposed of at a trial." 
	Obviously there are some matters which could be disposed of appropriately in this way. But this issue as to who was driving the vehicle in question was not a straightforward one. The claimant obviously thought one thing. She did so as a result of the circumstances of the accident, including the exchange of particulars which I have described as she did. Mr and Mrs Brown have been maintaining another since the claim was put to their own insurers, but Mr Brown had received those letters from the claimant's solicitors and insurance company and had done nothing, either himself or through his insurers, to correct the error. Yet he says in his witness statement that he does not know why it is that she can say that he was driving the car. 

 
	The judge does not refer at all to those early letters direct to Mr Brown in his judgment, but in any event it is plain that this was a serious live issue of fact of the sort that ought properly to be determined by hearing oral evidence from all involved. Whether this is done at a trial or as a separate issue is another question. 

 
	The second issue to arise in this appeal is the question of joining Mrs Brown as a party. There are two possible solutions to the problem that the limitation period against Mrs Brown had expired, albeit very recently. Both of those solutions stem from the Civil Procedure Rules, Rule 19.4. This again was not referred to by the learned judge in his judgment, and it may be that it was not referred to him. These provisions follow similar, but not identical, provisions in the Rules of the Supreme Court. The first relevant provision is rule 19.4(2): 

 
"The court may add or substitute a party only if- 
(a) the relevant limitation period was current when the proceedings were started; and 
(b) the addition or substitution is necessary." 
	Rule 19.4(3) provides: 

 
"The addition or substitution of a party is necessary only if the court is satisfied that- 
(a) the new party is to be substituted for a party who was named in the claim form in mistake for the new party; 
(b) the claim cannot properly be carried on by or against the original party unless the new party is added or substituted as claimant or defendant; or 
(c) ... " 
	Mr Walker QC, who has appeared for the appellant claimant, suggests that (a) is appropriate to this case. The proceedings were started within the limitation period and it would be appropriate to substitute Mrs Brown for Mr Brown because Mr Brown was named in mistake for Mrs Brown. If the judge had been right to decide the factual issue, then it is indeed possible that a claimant might accept that decision and argue as Mr Walker has done. This argument, however, raises very difficult issues as to the scope of this new rule. It is in wider terms than its predecessor in the Rules of the Supreme Court Order 20, rule 5(3). It also raises the question of how it may be reconciled with the Limitation Act 1980 in section 35(3) to (6), which places limitations on the suing of new parties after the limitation period has expired. It is unnecessary for us to decide those issues for the purpose of this appeal because the claimant's primary case is and has always been that Mr Brown was the driver of this car. If that turns out not to be the fact, then of course her case is that Mrs Brown was the driver. The question of substituting Mrs Brown for Mr Brown only arises if the factual issue has been properly determined beforehand. In this case (as for my part I have already suggested) it has not been so determined. 

 
	The second possibility therefore arises under the Civil Procedure Rules, rule 19.4(4): 

 
"In addition, in a claim for personal injuries the court may add or substitute a party where it directs that- 
(a) (i) section 11 (special time limit for claims for personal injuries); or
(ii) of section 12 (special time limit for claims under fatal accidents legislation), of the Limitation Act 1980
shall not apply to the claim by or against the new party; or 
(b) the issue of whether those sections apply shall be determined at trial." 
	The claimant (in the skeleton argument put in for her appeal) argued that the case for disapplying section 11 of the Limitation Act under the powers contained in section 33 of the Limitation Act 1980 was very strong. The defendant disputes that and says that further evidence, especially as to the reasons for the delay in issuing proceedings until the very end of the primary limitation period, would be needed.

 
	The judge relied heavily on, as I have said, the case of Howe v David Brown Tractors (Retail) Ltd. One can readily see how, in order to join a party, one must first have determined whether or not the limitation period should be disapplied. Nevertheless, there were two answers to that. The first is that the judge could have adjoined proceedings to enable such an application to have been made or, secondly, he could have made use of the power in rule 19.4(4)(b) to make Mrs Brown a party for this purpose and postpone the determination of the section 33 issue until the trial. Obviously, Mrs Brown would only be a party for the purpose of resisting that application under section 33 and the application to join (which is as it should be because it should not be forgotten this action is against Mr or Mrs Brown rather than against their insurers). 

 
	In my view, it was obviously the right course in this situation to make arrangements for the trial of the issue of identity and the issues of limitation and joinder together. It might perhaps be thought unlikely that in that event the parties would not agree matters in the interim. But I find it difficult to understand how this could be regarded as a disproportionate solution. I say that, if only because there is nothing at all to stop the claimant issuing separate proceedings, together with a section 33 application, against Mrs Brown in any event. To my mind that would indeed be a disproportionate response to what has taken place in this case. 

 
	I therefore would allow this appeal and, subject to any other views, direct that these issues be listed to be disposed of together. I would also add that in my personal view the real disproportion in this case is the defendant seeking to take a point like this in this way, where it is difficult to see that any real injustice has been done to Mr or Mrs Brown (or to their insurers) yet there would be a very real injustice to the claimant if it were to succeed. 

 
	MR JUSTICE RATTEE:  I agree. 

 
	LORD JUSTICE EVANS: I also agree and add a reference to the terms in which the defendant's application was made, for reasons which will appear. 

 
	The application dated 15th April 1999 was to strike out the claim against Mr McAlpine Brown, asserting that the grounds of the application were that he was not driving the vehicle at the relevant time and adding: 

 
"... a fact that was known to the Plaintiff." 
	Mr Lewers told us, on instructions, that the basis for the assertion by the solicitor on behalf of the defendant that Mrs Bridgeman had known that he was not the driver of the vehicle was a telephone conversation between the solicitor and Mr Brown on 18th March. If the solicitor had perused the correspondence which we have seen and had made any further enquiries of Mr Brown and of the insurers, the solicitor would have discovered, first, that there had been two letters to Mr Brown asserting that he was the driver. Those letters were not answered and they may well have been passed to the insurers. In another context, counsel submitted that that would have been the usual thing for the recipient of such letters to do. If we make that assumption and the letters were passed to the insurers, then the insurers were made aware in terms from the outset that Mrs Bridgeman was asserting that Mr McAlpine Brown was the driver. 

 
	Secondly, the solicitor would have discovered that throughout the whole of the correspondence between the claimant's insurers and solicitors and the defendant's insurers, there had been no hint of a suggestion that Mr McAlpine Brown was not the driver. Liability was admitted for the purposes of the negotiations on behalf of Mr Brown as "our insured" and there was no basis for such liability, except as driver of the vehicle. Specifically, the owner would not be liable for negligent driving merely by virtue of his ownership of the car. 

 
	It seems that the defendant's insurers overlooked the fact that in the original claim form addressed to them by Mr McAlpine Brown, he had said that his wife was the driver. The insurers could well overlook that fact because from their point of view it made no difference to their liability under the policy as to who was the driver. Then when proceedings were issued against Mr Brown (which was wholly understandable in the circumstances) the papers were passed to the defendant's solicitors. That was a few weeks after the limitation period expired, and the identity of the driver did become relevant because only Mr McAlpine Brown had been sued. The defendant's solicitors did not make the further inquiries to which I have referred. Instead they made their application on the basis that their assertion, for which there was no basis other than the say - so of Mr Brown as regards Mrs Bridgeman's knowledge, was correct. 

 
	It seems that the defendant's solicitors overlooked the fact that, at best from their client's point of view, there was an issue as to who the driver was. The terms of a letter which we have seen from the solicitors dated 6th May, shows that they were not prepared to acknowledge that there was such an issue. They merely asserted that what they had been told and had not enquired into was correct. If they had realised that there was an issue they would also have realised that there was no ground for striking out the claim, which was the draconian remedy that they sought. This attitude seems to have permeated the hearing before the learned judge in June, by which time the Civil Procedure Rules were in force. In the circumstances it remains unfortunate, but is perhaps less surprising, that the learned judge was persuaded to overlook the simple answer which was, as my Lady has said, to direct that there should be a trial on what was essentially an issue as to liability and adjourn to that trial the applications for leave to substitute or add Mrs McAlpine Brown as a party if that course should become necessary. 

 
	I have made this additional remarks because it seems to me that this was a bad example of taking a technical point (and what is more a wholly unmeritorious technical point) in the hope of preventing the court from deciding the case on its true merits. That was permitted under the Rules of the Supreme Court, but it is certainly contrary to the spirit of the Civil Procedure Rules. I would add that it was also contrary to what had become the best practice in civil litigation, even before 26th April 1999. 

 
	Taking such a point is not justified, in my view, by an appeal to the financial interests of the insurers or of their shareholders, such as has sometimes been suggested in cases such as this.

[
	LORD JUSTICE EVANS:  Lady Justice Hale will give the first judgment. 

 
	LADY JUSTICE HALE:  This is a claimant's appeal (with permission from Schiemann LJ) from the order of His Honour Judge Thompson QC made on 10th June 1999 in the Southampton County Court. The action arose out of a road traffic accident which took place on 29th February 1996. Proceedings were issued against the defendant, a Mr Brown, on 19th February 1999, just before the limitation period expired. A Defence was filed on 6th April 1999, claiming that the claimant had sued the wrong person. Mr Brown was the keeper of the vehicle and the policyholder, but his wife, Mrs Brown, was driving the car at the time. The defendant applied on 15th April 1999 for the claim to be struck out. The claimant applied on 17th May 1999 to join Mrs Brown as the second defendant. The learned judge granted the defendant's application and struck out the claim and refused the claimant's application. That, on the face of it, is, in the light of the circumstances of this case, a most unpalatable result. 

 
	The defendant's vehicle ran into the back of the claimant's vehicle which had stopped because a car ahead of her was waiting to turn right. Liability was never effectively in dispute. The claimant and Mr Brown exchanged particulars at the time. It is common ground that that exchange took place between the claimant and Mr Brown. It is the driver's obligation under the Road Traffic Act 1988 section 170(2) to give such particulars which should include his own name and address as well as the name of the owner and, under section 170(5), a certificate or evidence of insurance.

 
	As a result of this exchange the claimant informed her insurers, Direct Line. In her claim she named Mr Brown as the driver. On the 5th March 1996 Direct Line wrote to Mr Brown personally, as follows: 

 
"The information presented to us suggests that you were responsible ..." 
	and asking him to refer the matter to his insurers. On 16th March 1996 his insurers, Bradford-Pennine, wrote to Direct Line confirming that: 

 
"... for negotiation purposes liability will not be an issue." 
	The claimant also consulted solicitors. On 23rd April 1996 those solicitors wrote to Mr Brown personally as follows: 

 
"You are held wholly responsible for such loss, the accident having been caused by your negligent driving." 
	On the same day the solicitors wrote to his insurers, Bradford-Pennine: 

 
"Your insured is held wholly responsible for the said loss, the accident having been caused by negligent driving." 
	So it is quite clear at that stage whom the claimant, her insurers and her solicitors took to be the driver. 

 
	For my part, I do not see how references to the "driver of your insured's vehicle" in later letters from Direct Line to Bradford-Pennine, which are at best neutral, change that situation. No denials or clarifications were forthcoming, either from Mr Brown or from his insurers. It is clear from Mr and Mrs Brown's report to Bradford-Pennine (which is dated 5th March 1996) that they were both saying at that stage that Mrs Brown was the driver. Bradford-Pennine may therefore have known the position, but the claimant and her advisers certainly did not. 

 
	Thereafter there was correspondence between the claimant's solicitors and Bradford-Pennine on the basis that liability was not in dispute. Three interim payments were made; medical reports and statements were disclosed; an offer in settlement of general damages was made but rejected; further clarification of the special damage claim and loss of earnings was sought. On 3rd December 1998 the claimant's solicitors sent a schedule of special damage and supporting documents, and also said that the claimant's witness statement would follow shortly, as it did under cover of a letter of 17th December 1998. The letter of 3rd December had made it plain that the claimant's solicitors were aware that the limitation period was fast expiring. 

 
	A letter giving formal notice to Bradford-Pennine of the claimant's intention to proceed is dated 17th February 1999 and this asserted that the car was being driven by Mr Brown at the time. The first that the claimant knew that this was being disputed was, apparently, the defendant's solicitor's letter of 6th April 1999 enclosing a copy of the Defence and saying: 

 
"Liability for the accident is denied on behalf of Mr J McAlpine-Brown, since he was not driving at the time of the accident." 
	and suggesting that they discontinue the proceedings. Subsequently, witness statements were prepared from Mr Brown and his wife, saying that his wife was driving at the time. There was a witness statement from the claimant saying that she did not actually see the defendant driving before the accident, but she did see him get out of the driving seat. It was he with whom the conversations had taken place. It includes the words: 

 
"During our conversation the man did all the talking and wrote his details down on a piece of paper which he then gave to me. He gave his details as Mr J McAlpine-Brown of 2 Reeves Close, Draycot, Somerset. He also included the name of his insurance company which was Bradford-Pennine Insurance. I also gave him my details." 
	The claimant took the defendant, Mr Brown, to be the driver of the car which had run into her.

 
	The two applications, for a strike out and to add Mrs Brown as a party, were heard together. The judge did not hear oral evidence, but he did consider the factual issue as to who had been driving the car at the time. He held that all the direct evidence was to the effect that the defendant's wife had been driving: against that, he was only invited to draw an inference from the claimant's evidence that Mr Brown had been driving. Hence he concluded: 

 
"It seems to me quite clear, on the evidence which I have heard, that Mrs McAlpine-Brown was the driver." 
	That being so, the primary limitation period against Mrs Brown would have expired and so in order to make her a party he would have had to disapply it under section 33 of the Limitation Act 1980 before he could join her. He placed considerable reliance on the decision of this court in Howe v David Brown Tractors (Retail) Ltd [1991] 4 All ER 30. There was no application under section 33 of the 1980 Act before the court. He also indicated that an application to adjourn for that purpose had not been made: but in any case he would have refused such an application as it was wholly disproportionate to the value of this claim. The claim was outside the small claims track, but in his view undoubtedly within the fast-track limit. Therefore, in view of his decision as to who was the driver, if the claim could not be amended, it should be struck out. 

 
	In the course of his judgment he made the observation that: 

 
"What is so regrettable is that the proceedings were not incepted until the eleventh hour. If they had commenced earlier, this matter no doubt could and would, and certainly should, have been ironed out before the limitation period had expired, and all the problems that have arisen could have been avoided. But there it is: parties have three years in which to bring proceedings. If they choose to go to the wire, there is always the risk that they will be cut down by that wire." 
	As I said at the outset, in my view that result, in the circumstances which I have described, is a most unpalatable one. 

 
	What are the principles which apply on this appeal? One of the these applications (that is the defendant's application) was made before the Civil Procedure Rules came into force on 26th April 1999. The other one was made afterwards. Part 51 of those rules, and paragraph 15(3) of the Practice Direction associated with it, suggest that the principles of the Civil Procedure Rules should apply. It also appears that everyone in this case must have approached it on that basis, as will become apparent in a moment. There was, however, very little reference to the actual provisions of the rules in the judgment, and so it is possible to speculate (neither of the counsel who have appeared before us appeared below) that the judge himself was not referred to those provisions in detail. 

 
	The Civil Procedure Rules provide in Rule 1.1 that their overriding objective is to enable the court to deal with cases justly. Of course the question of proportionality comes into that question and the court's powers of active case management entail consideration of that issue. But again, for my part, to deprive a claimant of what on the face of it would otherwise be a cast iron claim, in circumstances such as those I have described, might not accord, it might be thought, with most people's sense of justice. 

 
	The first issue is whether the judge should have determined the question of the driver's identity summarily and, indeed, on paper evidence alone. The judge did not refer to the criteria for striking out a claim in the Civil Procedure Rules, rule 3.4(2). These allow the court to strike out a statement of case if it appears to the court: 

 
"(a) that the statement of case discloses no reasonable grounds for bringing or defending the claim; 
(b) that the statement of case is an abuse of the court's process or is otherwise likely to obstruct the justice disposal of the proceedings; or 
(c) that there has been a failure to comply with a rule, practice direction or court order." 
	The judge would not have been able to strike this claim out on those grounds, whether under the old rules or under the new. The essence of a strike out is that one does not look at the evidence on the claim. It is odd that the defendant's solicitors should have suggested this to the claimant. It also odd that they should have put into their application that the claimant knew the identity of the driver - which might of course have made it an abuse of process - when the only evidence for that assertion came from the Browns and does not appear in any communication or disclosure to the other side.

 
	Hence the learned judge could only dispose of the claim after a decision had been taken on the factual issue. It was, of course, open to him to decide that this was an issue which could be disposed of. He would be doing so, technically, not under a strike out application but under Part 24 of the Civil Procedure Rules which deals with summary judgment. For the first time it allows summary judgment to be given for the defendant as well as for the claimant. The grounds are set out in rule 24.2: 

 
"The court may give summary judgment against a claimant or defendant on the whole of a claim or on a particular issue if- 
(a) it considers that- 
(i) that claimant has no real prospect of succeeding on the claim or issue; ... and
...
(b) there is no other reason why the case or issue should be disposed of at a trial." 
	Obviously there are some matters which could be disposed of appropriately in this way. But this issue as to who was driving the vehicle in question was not a straightforward one. The claimant obviously thought one thing. She did so as a result of the circumstances of the accident, including the exchange of particulars which I have described as she did. Mr and Mrs Brown have been maintaining another since the claim was put to their own insurers, but Mr Brown had received those letters from the claimant's solicitors and insurance company and had done nothing, either himself or through his insurers, to correct the error. Yet he says in his witness statement that he does not know why it is that she can say that he was driving the car. 

 
	The judge does not refer at all to those early letters direct to Mr Brown in his judgment, but in any event it is plain that this was a serious live issue of fact of the sort that ought properly to be determined by hearing oral evidence from all involved. Whether this is done at a trial or as a separate issue is another question. 

 
	The second issue to arise in this appeal is the question of joining Mrs Brown as a party. There are two possible solutions to the problem that the limitation period against Mrs Brown had expired, albeit very recently. Both of those solutions stem from the Civil Procedure Rules, Rule 19.4. This again was not referred to by the learned judge in his judgment, and it may be that it was not referred to him. These provisions follow similar, but not identical, provisions in the Rules of the Supreme Court. The first relevant provision is rule 19.4(2): 

 
"The court may add or substitute a party only if- 
(a) the relevant limitation period was current when the proceedings were started; and 
(b) the addition or substitution is necessary." 
	Rule 19.4(3) provides: 

 
"The addition or substitution of a party is necessary only if the court is satisfied that- 
(a) the new party is to be substituted for a party who was named in the claim form in mistake for the new party; 
(b) the claim cannot properly be carried on by or against the original party unless the new party is added or substituted as claimant or defendant; or 
(c) ... " 
	Mr Walker QC, who has appeared for the appellant claimant, suggests that (a) is appropriate to this case. The proceedings were started within the limitation period and it would be appropriate to substitute Mrs Brown for Mr Brown because Mr Brown was named in mistake for Mrs Brown. If the judge had been right to decide the factual issue, then it is indeed possible that a claimant might accept that decision and argue as Mr Walker has done. This argument, however, raises very difficult issues as to the scope of this new rule. It is in wider terms than its predecessor in the Rules of the Supreme Court Order 20, rule 5(3). It also raises the question of how it may be reconciled with the Limitation Act 1980 in section 35(3) to (6), which places limitations on the suing of new parties after the limitation period has expired. It is unnecessary for us to decide those issues for the purpose of this appeal because the claimant's primary case is and has always been that Mr Brown was the driver of this car. If that turns out not to be the fact, then of course her case is that Mrs Brown was the driver. The question of substituting Mrs Brown for Mr Brown only arises if the factual issue has been properly determined beforehand. In this case (as for my part I have already suggested) it has not been so determined. 

 
	The second possibility therefore arises under the Civil Procedure Rules, rule 19.4(4): 

 
"In addition, in a claim for personal injuries the court may add or substitute a party where it directs that- 
(a) (i) section 11 (special time limit for claims for personal injuries); or
(ii) of section 12 (special time limit for claims under fatal accidents legislation), of the Limitation Act 1980
shall not apply to the claim by or against the new party; or 
(b) the issue of whether those sections apply shall be determined at trial." 
	The claimant (in the skeleton argument put in for her appeal) argued that the case for disapplying section 11 of the Limitation Act under the powers contained in section 33 of the Limitation Act 1980 was very strong. The defendant disputes that and says that further evidence, especially as to the reasons for the delay in issuing proceedings until the very end of the primary limitation period, would be needed.

 
	The judge relied heavily on, as I have said, the case of Howe v David Brown Tractors (Retail) Ltd. One can readily see how, in order to join a party, one must first have determined whether or not the limitation period should be disapplied. Nevertheless, there were two answers to that. The first is that the judge could have adjoined proceedings to enable such an application to have been made or, secondly, he could have made use of the power in rule 19.4(4)(b) to make Mrs Brown a party for this purpose and postpone the determination of the section 33 issue until the trial. Obviously, Mrs Brown would only be a party for the purpose of resisting that application under section 33 and the application to join (which is as it should be because it should not be forgotten this action is against Mr or Mrs Brown rather than against their insurers). 

 
	In my view, it was obviously the right course in this situation to make arrangements for the trial of the issue of identity and the issues of limitation and joinder together. It might perhaps be thought unlikely that in that event the parties would not agree matters in the interim. But I find it difficult to understand how this could be regarded as a disproportionate solution. I say that, if only because there is nothing at all to stop the claimant issuing separate proceedings, together with a section 33 application, against Mrs Brown in any event. To my mind that would indeed be a disproportionate response to what has taken place in this case. 

 
	I therefore would allow this appeal and, subject to any other views, direct that these issues be listed to be disposed of together. I would also add that in my personal view the real disproportion in this case is the defendant seeking to take a point like this in this way, where it is difficult to see that any real injustice has been done to Mr or Mrs Brown (or to their insurers) yet there would be a very real injustice to the claimant if it were to succeed. 

 
	MR JUSTICE RATTEE:  I agree. 

 
	LORD JUSTICE EVANS: I also agree and add a reference to the terms in which the defendant's application was made, for reasons which will appear. 

 
	The application dated 15th April 1999 was to strike out the claim against Mr McAlpine Brown, asserting that the grounds of the application were that he was not driving the vehicle at the relevant time and adding: 

 
"... a fact that was known to the Plaintiff." 
	Mr Lewers told us, on instructions, that the basis for the assertion by the solicitor on behalf of the defendant that Mrs Bridgeman had known that he was not the driver of the vehicle was a telephone conversation between the solicitor and Mr Brown on 18th March. If the solicitor had perused the correspondence which we have seen and had made any further enquiries of Mr Brown and of the insurers, the solicitor would have discovered, first, that there had been two letters to Mr Brown asserting that he was the driver. Those letters were not answered and they may well have been passed to the insurers. In another context, counsel submitted that that would have been the usual thing for the recipient of such letters to do. If we make that assumption and the letters were passed to the insurers, then the insurers were made aware in terms from the outset that Mrs Bridgeman was asserting that Mr McAlpine Brown was the driver. 

 
	Secondly, the solicitor would have discovered that throughout the whole of the correspondence between the claimant's insurers and solicitors and the defendant's insurers, there had been no hint of a suggestion that Mr McAlpine Brown was not the driver. Liability was admitted for the purposes of the negotiations on behalf of Mr Brown as "our insured" and there was no basis for such liability, except as driver of the vehicle. Specifically, the owner would not be liable for negligent driving merely by virtue of his ownership of the car. 

 
	It seems that the defendant's insurers overlooked the fact that in the original claim form addressed to them by Mr McAlpine Brown, he had said that his wife was the driver. The insurers could well overlook that fact because from their point of view it made no difference to their liability under the policy as to who was the driver. Then when proceedings were issued against Mr Brown (which was wholly understandable in the circumstances) the papers were passed to the defendant's solicitors. That was a few weeks after the limitation period expired, and the identity of the driver did become relevant because only Mr McAlpine Brown had been sued. The defendant's solicitors did not make the further inquiries to which I have referred. Instead they made their application on the basis that their assertion, for which there was no basis other than the say - so of Mr Brown as regards Mrs Bridgeman's knowledge, was correct.

[

LORD JUSTICE SWINTON THOMAS:  This is an appeal, with the leave of the single lord justice from an order as to costs made by Toulson J on 30th November 1998. The judge ordered that the defendants pay the claimant's costs of the action up to 26th August 1998, and that there should be no order as to costs between the parties thereafter. The importance of 26th August 1998 is that it was on that date that the relevant payment into court was made by the defendants.

 
The judge was trying a personal injury claim bought by Mr Brian Burgess against British Steel and Mr Wayne Anthony May, arising out of a road traffic accident which occurred on 7th January 1992. The second defendant, who was an employee of the first defendant, drove a lorry out of a garage forecourt and collided with the claimant's car. Mr Burgess was seriously injured. There was no dispute as to liability. The judge tried the issue as to quantum of damage only. The trial took place in November 1998 and the judge gave his judgment on 30th November. He awarded the claimant the sum of £161,592.22.

 
On 26th August £220,000 had been paid into court. In those circumstances Mr Browne, QC, for the defendant, submits that the judge was wrong in principle in not awarding the defendants their costs as from that date. This being an appeal in relation to costs it is of the first importance that one reminds oneself that the issue involved is one in relation to which the judge heard the case and heard all the evidence and was exercising a well recognised broad discretion. This Court, as the authority very plainly show, must be slow in interfering with an exercise of discretion of that nature.

 
It is necessary to refer, I hope in not too much detail, to the relevant facts and issues that arose in this case. They are set out with admirable clarity, if I may say so, in Toulson J's primary judgment. The claimant sustained serious physical injures in the accident. He had fractures of the left ankle and foot, a fracture of the left hand, a fracture of the right wrist and the nose, and a probable fracture of the left rib. He suffered much bruising in many parts of his body. He was left with permanent disabilities and his ability to enjoy life and take part in his hobbies and sport were considerably restricted. The judge assessed the general damages for pain and suffering and loss of amenity at  £31,500.

 
In addition to the physical injuries the claimant suffered psychological damage. The primary issues that arose for the judge's decision related to the extent of the psychological injury, the causation of the claimant's various symptoms, the financial consequences of the accident, the extent to which Mr Burgess' ability to earn had been adversely affected by the accident and the extent to which his financial problems were attributable to matters which were unrelated to the accident and the injuries sustained by Mr Burgess in the accident.

 
Mr Burgess was born on 1st April 1954 and was aged 37 as at the date of the accident; 44 as at the date of trial. His case was that, in addition to the physical injuries sustained by him in the accident, he suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder and a depressive illness.

 
Both sides commissioned medical reports including psychiatric reports. A Dr Jawad, a consultant psychiatrist instructed by the defendants, prepared a lengthy report dated 11th April 1998 in which he concluded, amongst other matters, that the claimant was  a malingerer. In the result, Dr Jawad was not called to give evidence at the trial. The claimant's advisors and the judge were informed that the defendants did not propose to call Dr Jawad just before the conclusion of the cross-examination of the claimant.

 
The claimant's case, supported by medical evidence, was that he suffered a post-traumatic stress disorder and a depressive illness. However, it transpired at the trial that the claimant's personal and working life were complex; and the judge concluded that his psychiatric and financial problems were properly attributable to a number of different causes of which the accident was but one. He married in 1974 and had three children by the marriage; that was ended in divorce in 1988. In that same year he commenced work with the Abbey Life Assurance Company as a self-employed salesman. His earnings were quite modest. In October 1991 he started work as an independent financial advisor, starting that work about three months or so before the relevant accident. Shortly before starting work as an independent financial advisor, he had commenced a relationship with a lady called Anita.

 
In June 1992 he set up his own independent business. That business continued between June 1992 and February 1995. That period spans the period after this accident. In 1994 he started to suffer from psychological problems and was treated by his general practitioner, Dr Carman, and a clinical psychologist, Mr Mackay, both of whom prepared medical reports which were before the judge. Neither of those practitioners was called to give evidence. Their reports dealt with various problems in Mr Burgess' life, including difficulties at work and difficulties in his relationship with Anita.

 
In March 1995 Dr Carman referred Mr Burgess to a Dr Britten, a consultant psychiatrist, who gave evidence at the hearing. In 1995 the relationship with Anita came to an end and towards the end of 1995 Mr Burgess sold his business. In 1996 he commenced a relationship with another lady.

 
In relation to the claimant as a witness the judge said this:

 
"In summary, I believe that he was fundamentally honest but at times confused and prone to give answers which seemed to assist his case without thinking carefully about their accuracy." 
Accordingly, the judge came to the conclusion that it  was necessary to treat the claimant's evidence about past events with considerable circumspection. Without making any criticism of Dr Britten, the judge also had reservations about some of the conclusions reached by him, largely because he did not see Mr Burgess until May 1995, by which time he had stopped work in his business.

 
On page 20 of his judgment the judge set out these conclusions:

 
"Considering these various factors in conjunction with the late onset of Mr Burgess' symptoms of depression and the evidence of Mr Cloutman, I do not believe that the accident was the dominant cause of Mr Burgess' depression; but I do accept that it contributed to his feelings of despondency about himself and lowered his ability to cope successfully with the other pressures which he faced. In that sense it was a contributory factor in the development of his illness. I also think that as time went by he increasingly focused in his own mind on the accident as the source of his troubles, and that itself has tended to prolong and intensify his symptoms.
As to the future, I accept Dr Britten's opinion that Mr Burgess needed the trial to be concluded in order to rebuild his life. In the future I would have thought that he could well go back to work as a tied agent or any other job involving his undoubted salesmanship skills, and that he has the ability to become again a creative and energetic person. He gets on well with other people. But nobody would recommend him to try to run his own business, least of all as an IFA."
The judge then turned to consider the financial claim put forward for loss of earnings and the loss of the  claimant's business. On page 22 of the judgment the judge said:

 
"The challenges which Mr Burgess faced in trying to establish his own business were different from those which he had ever previously experienced and put him under considerable stress, complicated by his relationship with Anita. I have not heard from her. But if she was wanting marriage and a family and Mr Burgess (as he told me) did not intend marriage, it is difficult to see that the relationship had a long term future. If not, he was going to have to refashion his business plans at a time of a breakdown in his personal relations. My impression of Mr Burgess is that although he had been a branch manager in the retail clothing business his strength lay in selling, at which he was very good, rather than business administration." 
And then a little further on:

 
"Taking into account both the general uncertainties of the small IFA market about which I heard evidence from experts and Mr Burgess' individual personality and situation (apart from the consequences of the accident itself), I have substantial doubts whether he would have made a long term success of the business in any event; but I accept that the accident diminished his prospects of doing so by making life physically more difficult for him and by contributing to the onset of his depression. There is in my view a somewhat greater likelihood that but for those factors he would have kept the business going for a rather longer time, disposed of it in a more orderly way and returned to some other employment, eg that of a tied agent, as Mr Goode offered."
The judge then awarded damages as set out on page 27 of the judgment:  Pain and suffering and loss of amenities  - £31,500; loss of earnings to trial - £35,071.45;

 
future loss of earnings - £56,566.80; capital loss - £2,589.80; loss of pension - £4,000; Other special damages - £9,485; other future loss - £9,000, making a  total of £148.213.05. When interest was added the total sum was £161,592.22.

 
The judge having given his judgment then heard submissions in relation to costs. It was submitted on behalf of the claimant that, in the light of the allegation contained in Dr Jawad's report and repeated in the defendants' skeleton argument that the claimant was a malingerer (in respect of which, as I have said, no evidence was called, with the result that that allegation was not proved against him) he should have the totality of his costs. The defendants submitted that they should have their costs as from the date of the payment in, the claimant having recovered substantially less than that payment.

 
The judge adopted a half-way house between those submissions and gave his ruling in which he set out his reasons. In the circumstances I think it is necessary that I should read the bulk of the judge's ruling. He said:

 
"It is well known that a plaintiff who fails to beat the payment in should pay the defendant's costs from the date of payment in unless there is some good reason to depart from the ordinary rule. Whether there is a sufficient justification to depart from that rule is a matter which lies in the discretion of the judge. Like all judicial discretions, it has to be exercised on the facts of the individual case, but recognising that the general rule should not be departed from save for good reason.
In this case the plaintiff submits that there is good reason in that the way in which the case was defended up to the trial went far beyond a denial that the plaintiff suffered the symptoms of which he complained as a result of the accident. This was a case which was all about the plaintiff's claimed psychiatric ill effects from the accident and the financial consequences of his having to give up his business when his mental health broke down.
The defendants served one medical report from a Dr Jawad, a consultant psychiatrist. His report was based on an interview with the plaintiff and tests which he carried out during interview, in the final paragraph of that report dated 11th April 1998 he stated: 'In conclusion Mr Burgess is a malingerer with respect to the psychiatric symptoms.'  In the event, Dr Jawad was not called as a witness. It was indicated, when cross-examination of the plaintiff began, that no final decision had been taken whether to call Dr Jawad or not. The final decision was made after the conclusion of the plaintiff's cross-examination.
The plaintiff says essentially two things about that. First, he says that the allegation made against him was very grave. It challenged in the squarest of terms his whole integrity and amounted to the accusation that he was bringing what he well knew to be a bogus claim, and that this allegation was maintained - or at least not dropped - until after the conclusion of his evidence albeit that no evidence was, in the event, brought to support it. He submits that it would not be just that one party who makes such a grave attack on the character of another and fails on it should be treated in the costs in the same way as if the attack had never been made. There is no general rule in this regard. The Court has to look at what is just on the facts of the case. Circumstances in which allegations of dishonesty are made and fail or are not pursued can vary infinitely.
Secondly, the plaintiff submits that a consequence of the way in which he believed the case was being made a against him was to lead him to view it in what turned out to be a false light. He and his advisers saw the case in stark terms: was he a conman or was he not?  His own response to the accusation was one of deep hurt. He and his advisers did not consider, in the way that they might otherwise have done, the risk that the Court would accept his integrity but conclude that his symptoms were  substantially the result of other factors. In the event, I did conclude that he was an essentially honest man, but there were elements of compensation neurosis, and I found that the accident was a contributory but far from the dominant cause of those symptoms.
What is the just cause for me to take?  I think that it is just that my order in the matter of costs should reflect the fact that this charge was made in a very serious and direct way; that it was sustained up to trial; and that in the event it was rejected by me, no evidence having been called to support it. I do not feel that it would be just that a plaintiff who has come to trial, of course in order to secure a damages award but also to fight off the allegation made, should end up having to bear the entire costs of the action in circumstances where, although he has failed to beat the payment in, he has left court without any stigma of malingering of a kind which had been levelled against him.
Secondly, I do not think that the plaintiff and his advisers ought to have failed to realise their need to prove that the symptoms were due to the accident, but I do have a measure of sympathy with him and his advisers when it is said that the whole way in which the case was viewed prior to trial in the light of the psychiatric evidence disclosed by the defendants was different from the way in which the trial in fact went. It often happens that trials go differently from the way in which they have been when anticipated; but where that is caused in part by one party launching a particular form of attack of a grave kind, which is then not carried through or fails, that is something which the Court can and should justly bear in mind when deciding where the costs ought to lie.
I think that the plaintiff asks too much when he asks that he should have the costs of the action. That fails to reflect the fact that he has failed to beat the payment in which, on sober analysis, ought to be have been accepted. But looking at the matter in quite broad terms, and asking myself what I think is fair, I think that fairness and justice would be done on the special facts of this case if I make no order as to costs from the date of the payment in."
As I have already said, Mr Browne, on behalf of the  defendants, submits that the judge plainly fell into error in making that order and that he should have followed the usual course of ordering a claimant who has failed to beat the payment in, to pay the cost as from that date, and that there were no circumstances in this particular case which justified the judge in departing from the general rule. The primary question that arises is whether there were facts in this case, which justified the judge in making an unusual order.

 
Mr Browne relies on the general principles set out in the judgment of Lord Somervell LJ in Findlay v Railway Executive [1950] 2 All ER 969 at 971 when he said:

 
"The first point to be decided here is whether a defendant who has paid money into court which has not been taken out and exceeds the sum awarded to the plaintiff is a successful litigant or a successful party within those two statements of the law. I hold that he is, and that the principles there laid down apply. The main purpose of the rules for payment into court is the hope that further litigation will be avoided, the plaintiff being encouraged to take out the sum paid in, if it be a reasonable sum, whereas, if he goes on and gets a smaller sum, he will be penalised wholly or to some extent in costs. Once, therefore, the money has been paid in, the lis between the parties simply is: is that sum sufficient to cover the damage which has been suffered. Prima facie, therefore, the defendants in the present case are entitled to be paid their costs as from the date of payment in. But, of course, as in other cases, there may be circumstances connected with the case which entitled the judge to make some order other than that of giving the successful litigant his costs, and counsel for the plaintiff submitted that there were such circumstances in this case."
That passage has been reflected in the Rules of the Supreme Court. It has been submitted on behalf of the defendants that the prima facie rule must apply; and it is submitted by Mr Kemp on behalf of the claimant that there were the special circumstances to which Somervell LJ made reference, which justified the judge in departing from the general rule.

 
Mr Browne also referred us to a recent case, Ford v GKR Construction and Others the judgment being given on 22nd October 1999 in Cardiff and reported in the Times on 5th November 1999. The appeal heard by the Master of the Rolls, Pill LJ and Judge LJ was an appeal in relation to costs. It was a case in which a payment into court had been made. The claimant failed to beat the payment in but the judge ordered that the defendant should nonetheless pay the claimant's costs, the Court holding that in the particular circumstances of that case the judge was entitled to make the order that he did. That case is relied upon by Mr Kemp. However, Mr Browne submits, rightly in my judgment, that there are clear distinctions to be drawn between Ford and the instant case. In Ford the hearing was adjourned, and in the course of the adjournment the defendants instructed an  inquiry agent who took a video recording of the claimant; that video recording entirely changing the nature of the case. When the video recording was disclosed to the claimant and her advisors she then tried to settle the action but was unsuccessful in doing so. In those circumstances, this Court held that the judge was entitled to exercise his discretion in the way in which he did, but as I have indicated, the present case is quite different from that case.

 
Mr Browne then submits, however, that the only special circumstance which arose in this case is that a consultant psychiatrist was instructed by the defendants who came to the conclusion that the claimant was malingering. Mr Browne points to the fact that that doctor was not called to give evidence. He submits that the mere serving of a medical report containing that allegation cannot be a special circumstance which would justify the judge in departing from the usual rule that if a claimant fails to beat a payment into court then he or she must pay the costs as from the date of the payment in.

 
Mr Browne then points to the fact that Dr Jawad's report was prepared on 11th April 1998 and served on the  claimant and his advisors shortly thereafter, with the result that he and his advisors had full knowledge of the allegations that were contained in the report when the decision was made not to accept the money which had been paid into court within the period of 21 days allowed by the rules for such acceptance. Mr Browne then finally submitted, again with some justification, that a payment into court of this magnitude indicated that the defendants appreciated that the allegation of malingering was one which was unlikely to succeed. Mr Kemp, in an admirably succinct submission, said this was a case where the judge heard the evidence and was exercising a discretion, and he exercised that discretion on proper and appropriate grounds in the course of the judgment of which I have read.

 
The appropriate principles to be followed in considering an award of costs after a payment into court are set out in a judgment given by this Court on 13th October 1999 in Jones v Jones. On page 19 of the judgment Chadwick LJ said in relation to the provisions of the Rules:

 
"The scheme of those provisions is clear. Money may be paid in at any time. In particular, it may be paid in before the disclosure of the witness statements and expert reports on which the defendant will rely; and so, before the plaintiff knows the full extent of the defendant's case. The plaintiff has 21 days in which to decide whether to take the payment out of court. If the plaintiff decides to do that, it can be done without  leave. The plaintiff makes that decision on the basis of his assessment, under advice and on the materials then available of the risk of failing to obtain an award of damages greater than the amount of the payment in court. If the plaintiff decides not to accept the payment in within the 21 day period, then he cannot accept it without leave. But it is always open to him to reassess the risk in the light of anything which subsequently emerges in the course of the proceedings, including anything which emerges in the course of the trial. In particular, the plaintiff can reassess the risk in the light of witness statements and experts' reports which are disclosed by the defendant after the date of the payment in." 
As I have already said, the claimant in this case was in possession of Dr Jawad's report prior to the payment in. He was fully aware as of the date of the payment in of all the risks that were involved in the litigation. The issue that arose in this case for the judge's decision was the amount of money that should be awarded to the claimant in the action. There were, of course, as is always the case in a complex personal injury case, a number of sub-issues, including the suggestion of malingering; but all those matters in this case were subsidiary to the primary issue. In a personal injury case, in particular one involving alleged psychological damage, a number of factual issues are likely to arise on some of which the claimant may succeed and on some of which the defendants may succeed. However, in the great majority of cases, those issues form a part of the evidential pattern leading to an overall conclusion as  to the amount of money that the claimant recovers. It is, in my judgment, unusual to deprive a defendant who has paid a sum of money into court well in excess of the claim of any part of his costs because he was unsuccessful on a particular evidential issue, although it may be open to the Court to deprive that party of the costs relating to the issue itself. In the same way it would be unusual to deprive a claimant of his costs in a personal injury claim if he had beaten the payment into court but had not been successful on certain evidential issues.

 
Bearing in mind the way in which the judge arrived at his conclusion on the costs issue, it is perhaps worthy of note that the question of malingering is not mentioned in the judge's primary judgment at all; that is not surprising when it was not pursued by the defendants at the conclusion of the claimant's cross-examination.

 
The judge based his order (at least in part) on the concept that the claimant had to come to court to fight off the allegation that he was a malingerer. There is no evidence at all, and indeed it is unlikely to be the fact that the claimant came to court in order to defeat  that allegation, save in the sense that it was necessary to do so in order to recover the damages claimed by him. There is no evidence that he came to court to maintain his good character as opposed to recovering the sum of damages which he considered he was entitled to recover. He did not, for example - and not surprisingly  - through his solicitors, write to the defendants saying that he would accept the money on offer if the allegation of malingering was withdrawn. I have little doubt that if that offer had been proposed it would have been accepted.

 
In a personal injury action of this kind where there is a substantial claim for loss of earnings based substantially on psychological damage, it is, in my judgment, plain beyond peradventure that the issues such as the stress imposed by personal relationships, the claimant's ability to run a business on his own, the problems that arose in the financial services sector at the material time, would all be at the centre of the debate, as indeed they were at the centre of the evidence and at the centre of the judge's findings, which resulted in the claimant's failure to beat the payment into court. As the judge said the claimant and his advisors ought to have appreciated that they must  prove that his symptoms and his financial losses were caused by the accident. In my view, Mr Browne is right in submitting, on the basis of the judge's primary judgment, that the real issue in this case was one of causation. It was necessary for the claimant to prove that his losses resulted from the accident, and he failed to do so to the extent of recovering more than the payment into court.

 
I understand the judge's feelings of sympathy towards this claimant, but, in my view, the fact that, in a medical report the defendants made an allegation that the claimant was malingering, is not of itself sufficient to permit the judge to depart from the normal rule as to costs following a payment into court. In the well known case of In Re Elgindata Ltd 2 [1992] 1 WLR at 1207, this Court held that the general rule that costs should follow the event unless there were circumstances suggesting some other order should be made did not cease to apply merely because a successful party had raised issues or made allegations which he had failed to establish at the hearing of the action; a successful party to an action would not have acted improperly or unreasonably in raising issues, and if he had not done that he ought not to be ordered to pay any part of the  unsuccessful party's costs. It does not seem to me, in the circumstances that arose in this case, that it could be said that the defendants had acted improperly or unreasonably in raising the issues that they did. The facts of Elgindata were very different of course to the facts of the present case; but the principle is the same.

 
In this case, by reason of the payment in the defendants had become the successful party and "the event" was the failure of the claimant to recover more than the payment in. I have no doubt that the judge did have, as I have said, considerable sympathy with this seriously injured claimant when he appreciated that his order meant that the claimant had failed to beat the payment in, with the result that he had to pay all the costs since the date of the payment in, and there would be little, if anything, left for him. I share that sympathy. I also, if I may say so, sympathise with the judge's approach to the costs issue. However, I am wholly persuaded that in this case the judge did fall into error and has been shown to have been wrong. The judge is very experienced in this field, and I stress again as I did at the outset of this judgment, that he both heard the evidence and was exercising a discretion. However, I am persuaded  that there was no proper basis in this particular case upon which to depart from the general rule that if a claimant fails to beat the payment into court then the defendants should be entitled to their costs as from that date. Accordingly I would allow the appeal.

 
LORD JUSTICE CHADWICK:  I agree.

 
There is no dispute as to the principles which govern the award of costs in a case in which there has been a payment into court of an amount which exceeds the amount of the damages and interest to which the claimant is held to be entitled after trial. Put shortly, from the date of the payment in, or more accurately, from a date which will usually be 21 days after the date of the payment in, the claimant pursues his action on the basis that, if he does not beat the payment in, he will be treated, for the purposes of the Court's discretion as to costs, as if he were the loser. The consequence is that, applying the general principle that costs follow the event, it will be appropriate to make an order that the claimant pays the costs after that date, unless it appears to the Court that in the circumstances of the particular case some other order should be made as to the whole or any part of those costs.

 
The judge took the view that there were circumstances which enabled him to make some order other than an order which reflected the fact that the claimant had pursued a claim after a date when he could have taken out of court more than the amount to which he was eventually held to be entitled. The judge took that view on the basis that the claimant was facing a serious allegation that he was a malingerer, which he was entitled to meet and defend at a trial. In a passage to which Swinton Thomas LJ has already referred, the judge said this:

 
"I think that it is just that my order in the matter of costs should reflect the fact that this charge was made in a very serious and direct way; that it was sustained up to the trial; and that in the event it was rejected by me, no evidence having been called to support it. I do not feel that it would be just that a plaintiff who has come to trial, of course in order to secure a damages award but also to fight off the allegation made, should end up having to bear the entire costs of the action in circumstances where, although he has failed to beat the payment in, he left court without any stigma of malingering of a kind which had been levelled against him." 
The judge must have intended to refer in that passage to the liability to pay the costs of the action after the payment in, rather than "the entire costs of the action."  There was never any suggestion that the claimant should not have the costs of the action up to the time of her payment in.

 
The allegation of malingering was an allegation with which this claimant was faced when he made the decision, following the payment in on 25th August 1998 of the final instalment by the defendants, to pursue the action. It is impossible to conclude that this decision to pursue her action, insofar as it was made on financial grounds alone, would have been different if the claimant had known in August 1998, or thereafter, that the allegation of malingering would not be pursued. The chances of recovering were reduced, not increased, by the existence of an allegation of malingering. So an actual decision to pursue the action in circumstances in which the allegation was being made is consistent only with a putative decision to pursue the action if the allegation was not being made - at least if the two decisions are treated as made on financial grounds. The claimant cannot be heard to say that the hurdles which he had to surmount were increased by anything which happened after the payment in. In fact, the hurdles diminished, in that the allegation of malingering was not pursued at the trial.

 
The judge's approach leads, I think, to the conclusion that there was nothing that the defendant could do by way of payment in to prevent this trial proceeding. No matter how large the amount that was paid in, the  defendants could not protect themselves against the risk of having to bear its own costs of the trial. It could do so only by withdrawing Dr Jawad's report or any reliance upon it.

 
The claimant's difficulty, as it seems to me, is that he never suggested that Dr Jawad's report was the reason why he was pursuing his claim. The defendants were entitled to take the view that the claim was being pursued for the reason that personal injury claims are usually pursued; namely, in order to obtain an award of damages. Had the defendants been told that the claimant was content with the amount on offer, but was pursuing the claim only in order to obtain a retraction of Dr Jawad's report, the defendants would have been in a position to take appropriate steps. But that was never made clear to the defendants; and in those circumstances it seems to me that there was no reason why the claimant should not bear the ordinary risk, namely, the risk of having to pay the defendants' costs if he pursued a damages claim after a payment into court of a substantial amount.

 
I am conscious, as this Court must always be conscious, of the importance of respecting the exercise of the  trial judge's discretion in relation to costs; particularly in circumstances where the trial judge has had the advantage of a much clearer understanding than an appellate court can have of the factors which affected the course of the litigation which he tried. But in my view, the reason which the judge gave for departing from the ordinary rule as to the award of costs in these cases is one which cannot be supported.

 
In those circumstances it seems to me that this Court is required to set aside the judge's order; and is entitled to exercise its own discretion.

 
For those reasons I, too, would allow this appeal.

 
LORD JUSTICE CLARKE:  I agree that this appeal should be allowed although I have perhaps found the case more difficult than my Lords. The relevant principles have most recently been set out in the judgment of my Lord, Chadwick LJ, in Jones v Jones (unreported) on 13th October 1999 and in the other cases to which my Lord, Swinton Thomas LJ has referred. The judge expressed the principles in this way:

 
"It is well known that a plaintiff who fails to beat the payment in should pay the defendant's costs from the date of payment in unless there is some good reason to depart from the ordinary rule. Whether there is a  sufficient justification to depart from that rule is a matter which lies in the discretion of the judge. Like all judicial discretions, it has to be exercised on the facts of the individual case, but recognising that the general rule should not be departed from save for good reason."
To my mind that statement of principle is correct. The question for the judge was whether there was good reason to depart from the general rule on the facts of the instant case. That depends on all the circumstances of the case as they appeared to the judge when he was asked to exercise his discretion. Those circumstances can, in my judgment, include events after the date of payment of the payment in. For example, they can include the way in which the defendants conducted the case, including the trial.

 
In the instance case, the judge, who of course had the great advantage of having presided over the trial, took account, amongst other things, of the following facts. The defendants served the opinion of Dr Jawad which included a statement of his view that the respondent was a malingerer. That opinion was sent to the judge before the trial, presumably on the basis that it was evidence upon which the defendants intended to rely. That is plain from the fact that they relied upon that report in their skeleton argument which was also put before the  judge. Some of the contents of the report were put to the plaintiff in cross-examination. The word "malingerer" was not used, but some of the answers which he had given to Dr Jawad were put to him. He said that he had become upset. This exchange then occurred:

 
"Q. You say you became upset. In what
way did you become upset?
A. Because I couldn't answer the questions. (Witness upset).
Q. So you are saying, are you, that youranswers were influenced by the fact  that you were very upset rather than being true attempts to answer the questions?
A. No, I really tried to answer the  questions but they just became so complicated. I just could not answerthem and by the time you finished with  me I couldn't -- I just -- I was so ashamed that I could not answer the  questions and when I walked out ofthere I just felt like nothing.
Q. You were sure that that is the explanation rather than an attempt toplay up the symptoms as best you could, Mr Jawad?
A. No, no. "
After the cross-examination the judge was informed that the defendants would not rely upon Dr Jawad's report.

 
In reaching his conclusion on costs, the judge, in passages to which my Lords have variously referred, said this:

 
"What is the just cause for me to take?  I think that it is just that my order in the matter of costs should reflect the fact that this charge was made in a very serious and direct way; that is was sustained up to trial; and that in the event it was rejected by me, no evidences having been called to support it. I do not  feel that it would be just that a plaintiff who has come to trial, of course in order to secure a damages award but also to fight off the allegation made, should end up having to bear the entire costs of the action in circumstances where, although he has failed to beat the payment in, he has left court without any stigma of malingering of a kind which had been levelled against him.
Secondly, I do not think that the plaintiff and his advisers ought to have failed to realise their need to prove that the symptoms were due to the accident, but I do have a measure of sympathy with him and his advisers when it is said that the whole way in which the case was viewed prior to trial in the light of the psychiatric evidence disclosed by the defendants was different from the way in which the trial in fact went. It often happens that trials go differently from the way in which they have been anticipated; but where that is caused in part by one party launching a particular form of attack of a grave kind, which is then not carried through or fails, that is something which the Court can and should justly bear in mind when deciding where the costs ought to lie.
I think that the plaintiff asks too much when he asks that he should have the costs of the action. That fails to reflect the fact that he has failed to beat the payment in which, on sober analysis, ought to have been accepted. But looking at the matter in quite broad terms, and asking myself what I think is fair, I think that fairness and justice would be done on the special facts of this case if I make no order as to the costs from the date of the payment in."
The question is whether the exercise of the judge's discretion in that way was plainly wrong in the light of the relevant principles. The judge would, in my opinion, have been entitled to deprive the defendants of the costs of instructing Dr Jawad and in particular of the costs relevant to the allegation that the respondent was a malingerer. He could, in my judgment, have done  so consistently with the principles in In Re Elgindata Ltd (No.2) [1992] 1 WLR 1207 per Nourse LJ at 1214.

 
The question is whether it was outside the permissible exercise of the judge's discretion to deprive the defendants of all their costs after the payment in, or, more accurately, after 21 days from the payment in. I have reached the conclusion that it was. There is no evidence that one of the causes of the respondent proceeding with its case after the payment in was the allegation of malingering. If the judge reached a different conclusion in any of the passages quoted above I regret that I am unable to agree with him.

 
The respondent's object in pressing the matter to trial was, in my judgment, plainly to try to obtain more than the £220,000 paid into court. The defendants were thus bound to incur substantial costs as a result of the respondent's decision to reject the payment in and to fight for more. Quite apart from the evidence of Dr Jawad and the issue of malingering, that decision inevitably led to the defendants incurring very substantial costs. In these circumstances, I do not see how the allegation of malingering, if I may so describe it, could possibly justify depriving the defendants of  all their costs. In these circumstances, the exercise by the judge of his discretion by depriving the defendants of all their costs was outside the permissible range of the exercise of that discretion. For this reason I agree that the appeal should be allowed. As I see it, the question which will now arise is how this Court should exercise its discretion, given the conclusions reached by the judge.

 
(Appeal allowed with costs as from 21 days after payment in. Defendants will not recover any costs incurred in relation to Dr Jawad or in relation to the malingering issue).

[

LORD JUSTICE SWINTON THOMAS:  This is an appeal, with the leave of the single lord justice from an order as to costs made by Toulson J on 30th November 1998. The judge ordered that the defendants pay the claimant's costs of the action up to 26th August 1998, and that there should be no order as to costs between the parties thereafter. The importance of 26th August 1998 is that it was on that date that the relevant payment into court was made by the defendants.

 
The judge was trying a personal injury claim bought by Mr Brian Burgess against British Steel and Mr Wayne Anthony May, arising out of a road traffic accident which occurred on 7th January 1992. The second defendant, who was an employee of the first defendant, drove a lorry out of a garage forecourt and collided with the claimant's car. Mr Burgess was seriously injured. There was no dispute as to liability. The judge tried the issue as to quantum of damage only. The trial took place in November 1998 and the judge gave his judgment on 30th November. He awarded the claimant the sum of £161,592.22.

 
On 26th August £220,000 had been paid into court. In those circumstances Mr Browne, QC, for the defendant, submits that the judge was wrong in principle in not awarding the defendants their costs as from that date. This being an appeal in relation to costs it is of the first importance that one reminds oneself that the issue involved is one in relation to which the judge heard the case and heard all the evidence and was exercising a well recognised broad discretion. This Court, as the authority very plainly show, must be slow in interfering with an exercise of discretion of that nature.

 
It is necessary to refer, I hope in not too much detail, to the relevant facts and issues that arose in this case. They are set out with admirable clarity, if I may say so, in Toulson J's primary judgment. The claimant sustained serious physical injures in the accident. He had fractures of the left ankle and foot, a fracture of the left hand, a fracture of the right wrist and the nose, and a probable fracture of the left rib. He suffered much bruising in many parts of his body. He was left with permanent disabilities and his ability to enjoy life and take part in his hobbies and sport were considerably restricted. The judge assessed the general damages for pain and suffering and loss of amenity at  £31,500.

 
In addition to the physical injuries the claimant suffered psychological damage. The primary issues that arose for the judge's decision related to the extent of the psychological injury, the causation of the claimant's various symptoms, the financial consequences of the accident, the extent to which Mr Burgess' ability to earn had been adversely affected by the accident and the extent to which his financial problems were attributable to matters which were unrelated to the accident and the injuries sustained by Mr Burgess in the accident.

 
Mr Burgess was born on 1st April 1954 and was aged 37 as at the date of the accident; 44 as at the date of trial. His case was that, in addition to the physical injuries sustained by him in the accident, he suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder and a depressive illness.

 
Both sides commissioned medical reports including psychiatric reports. A Dr Jawad, a consultant psychiatrist instructed by the defendants, prepared a lengthy report dated 11th April 1998 in which he concluded, amongst other matters, that the claimant was  a malingerer. In the result, Dr Jawad was not called to give evidence at the trial. The claimant's advisors and the judge were informed that the defendants did not propose to call Dr Jawad just before the conclusion of the cross-examination of the claimant.

 
The claimant's case, supported by medical evidence, was that he suffered a post-traumatic stress disorder and a depressive illness. However, it transpired at the trial that the claimant's personal and working life were complex; and the judge concluded that his psychiatric and financial problems were properly attributable to a number of different causes of which the accident was but one. He married in 1974 and had three children by the marriage; that was ended in divorce in 1988. In that same year he commenced work with the Abbey Life Assurance Company as a self-employed salesman. His earnings were quite modest. In October 1991 he started work as an independent financial advisor, starting that work about three months or so before the relevant accident. Shortly before starting work as an independent financial advisor, he had commenced a relationship with a lady called Anita.

 
In June 1992 he set up his own independent business. That business continued between June 1992 and February 1995. That period spans the period after this accident. In 1994 he started to suffer from psychological problems and was treated by his general practitioner, Dr Carman, and a clinical psychologist, Mr Mackay, both of whom prepared medical reports which were before the judge. Neither of those practitioners was called to give evidence. Their reports dealt with various problems in Mr Burgess' life, including difficulties at work and difficulties in his relationship with Anita.

 
In March 1995 Dr Carman referred Mr Burgess to a Dr Britten, a consultant psychiatrist, who gave evidence at the hearing. In 1995 the relationship with Anita came to an end and towards the end of 1995 Mr Burgess sold his business. In 1996 he commenced a relationship with another lady.

 
In relation to the claimant as a witness the judge said this:

 
"In summary, I believe that he was fundamentally honest but at times confused and prone to give answers which seemed to assist his case without thinking carefully about their accuracy." 
Accordingly, the judge came to the conclusion that it  was necessary to treat the claimant's evidence about past events with considerable circumspection. Without making any criticism of Dr Britten, the judge also had reservations about some of the conclusions reached by him, largely because he did not see Mr Burgess until May 1995, by which time he had stopped work in his business.

 
On page 20 of his judgment the judge set out these conclusions:

 
"Considering these various factors in conjunction with the late onset of Mr Burgess' symptoms of depression and the evidence of Mr Cloutman, I do not believe that the accident was the dominant cause of Mr Burgess' depression; but I do accept that it contributed to his feelings of despondency about himself and lowered his ability to cope successfully with the other pressures which he faced. In that sense it was a contributory factor in the development of his illness. I also think that as time went by he increasingly focused in his own mind on the accident as the source of his troubles, and that itself has tended to prolong and intensify his symptoms.
As to the future, I accept Dr Britten's opinion that Mr Burgess needed the trial to be concluded in order to rebuild his life. In the future I would have thought that he could well go back to work as a tied agent or any other job involving his undoubted salesmanship skills, and that he has the ability to become again a creative and energetic person. He gets on well with other people. But nobody would recommend him to try to run his own business, least of all as an IFA."
The judge then turned to consider the financial claim put forward for loss of earnings and the loss of the  claimant's business. On page 22 of the judgment the judge said:

 
"The challenges which Mr Burgess faced in trying to establish his own business were different from those which he had ever previously experienced and put him under considerable stress, complicated by his relationship with Anita. I have not heard from her. But if she was wanting marriage and a family and Mr Burgess (as he told me) did not intend marriage, it is difficult to see that the relationship had a long term future. If not, he was going to have to refashion his business plans at a time of a breakdown in his personal relations. My impression of Mr Burgess is that although he had been a branch manager in the retail clothing business his strength lay in selling, at which he was very good, rather than business administration." 
And then a little further on:

 
"Taking into account both the general uncertainties of the small IFA market about which I heard evidence from experts and Mr Burgess' individual personality and situation (apart from the consequences of the accident itself), I have substantial doubts whether he would have made a long term success of the business in any event; but I accept that the accident diminished his prospects of doing so by making life physically more difficult for him and by contributing to the onset of his depression. There is in my view a somewhat greater likelihood that but for those factors he would have kept the business going for a rather longer time, disposed of it in a more orderly way and returned to some other employment, eg that of a tied agent, as Mr Goode offered."
The judge then awarded damages as set out on page 27 of the judgment:  Pain and suffering and loss of amenities  - £31,500; loss of earnings to trial - £35,071.45;

 
future loss of earnings - £56,566.80; capital loss - £2,589.80; loss of pension - £4,000; Other special damages - £9,485; other future loss - £9,000, making a  total of £148.213.05. When interest was added the total sum was £161,592.22.

 
The judge having given his judgment then heard submissions in relation to costs. It was submitted on behalf of the claimant that, in the light of the allegation contained in Dr Jawad's report and repeated in the defendants' skeleton argument that the claimant was a malingerer (in respect of which, as I have said, no evidence was called, with the result that that allegation was not proved against him) he should have the totality of his costs. The defendants submitted that they should have their costs as from the date of the payment in, the claimant having recovered substantially less than that payment.

 
The judge adopted a half-way house between those submissions and gave his ruling in which he set out his reasons. In the circumstances I think it is necessary that I should read the bulk of the judge's ruling. He said:

 
"It is well known that a plaintiff who fails to beat the payment in should pay the defendant's costs from the date of payment in unless there is some good reason to depart from the ordinary rule. Whether there is a sufficient justification to depart from that rule is a matter which lies in the discretion of the judge. Like all judicial discretions, it has to be exercised on the facts of the individual case, but recognising that the general rule should not be departed from save for good reason.
In this case the plaintiff submits that there is good reason in that the way in which the case was defended up to the trial went far beyond a denial that the plaintiff suffered the symptoms of which he complained as a result of the accident. This was a case which was all about the plaintiff's claimed psychiatric ill effects from the accident and the financial consequences of his having to give up his business when his mental health broke down.
The defendants served one medical report from a Dr Jawad, a consultant psychiatrist. His report was based on an interview with the plaintiff and tests which he carried out during interview, in the final paragraph of that report dated 11th April 1998 he stated: 'In conclusion Mr Burgess is a malingerer with respect to the psychiatric symptoms.'  In the event, Dr Jawad was not called as a witness. It was indicated, when cross-examination of the plaintiff began, that no final decision had been taken whether to call Dr Jawad or not. The final decision was made after the conclusion of the plaintiff's cross-examination.
The plaintiff says essentially two things about that. First, he says that the allegation made against him was very grave. It challenged in the squarest of terms his whole integrity and amounted to the accusation that he was bringing what he well knew to be a bogus claim, and that this allegation was maintained - or at least not dropped - until after the conclusion of his evidence albeit that no evidence was, in the event, brought to support it. He submits that it would not be just that one party who makes such a grave attack on the character of another and fails on it should be treated in the costs in the same way as if the attack had never been made. There is no general rule in this regard. The Court has to look at what is just on the facts of the case. Circumstances in which allegations of dishonesty are made and fail or are not pursued can vary infinitely.
Secondly, the plaintiff submits that a consequence of the way in which he believed the case was being made a against him was to lead him to view it in what turned out to be a false light. He and his advisers saw the case in stark terms: was he a conman or was he not?  His own response to the accusation was one of deep hurt. He and his advisers did not consider, in the way that they might otherwise have done, the risk that the Court would accept his integrity but conclude that his symptoms were  substantially the result of other factors. In the event, I did conclude that he was an essentially honest man, but there were elements of compensation neurosis, and I found that the accident was a contributory but far from the dominant cause of those symptoms.
What is the just cause for me to take?  I think that it is just that my order in the matter of costs should reflect the fact that this charge was made in a very serious and direct way; that it was sustained up to trial; and that in the event it was rejected by me, no evidence having been called to support it. I do not feel that it would be just that a plaintiff who has come to trial, of course in order to secure a damages award but also to fight off the allegation made, should end up having to bear the entire costs of the action in circumstances where, although he has failed to beat the payment in, he has left court without any stigma of malingering of a kind which had been levelled against him.
Secondly, I do not think that the plaintiff and his advisers ought to have failed to realise their need to prove that the symptoms were due to the accident, but I do have a measure of sympathy with him and his advisers when it is said that the whole way in which the case was viewed prior to trial in the light of the psychiatric evidence disclosed by the defendants was different from the way in which the trial in fact went. It often happens that trials go differently from the way in which they have been when anticipated; but where that is caused in part by one party launching a particular form of attack of a grave kind, which is then not carried through or fails, that is something which the Court can and should justly bear in mind when deciding where the costs ought to lie.
I think that the plaintiff asks too much when he asks that he should have the costs of the action. That fails to reflect the fact that he has failed to beat the payment in which, on sober analysis, ought to be have been accepted. But looking at the matter in quite broad terms, and asking myself what I think is fair, I think that fairness and justice would be done on the special facts of this case if I make no order as to costs from the date of the payment in."
As I have already said, Mr Browne, on behalf of the  defendants, submits that the judge plainly fell into error in making that order and that he should have followed the usual course of ordering a claimant who has failed to beat the payment in, to pay the cost as from that date, and that there were no circumstances in this particular case which justified the judge in departing from the general rule. The primary question that arises is whether there were facts in this case, which justified the judge in making an unusual order.

 
Mr Browne relies on the general principles set out in the judgment of Lord Somervell LJ in Findlay v Railway Executive [1950] 2 All ER 969 at 971 when he said:

 
"The first point to be decided here is whether a defendant who has paid money into court which has not been taken out and exceeds the sum awarded to the plaintiff is a successful litigant or a successful party within those two statements of the law. I hold that he is, and that the principles there laid down apply. The main purpose of the rules for payment into court is the hope that further litigation will be avoided, the plaintiff being encouraged to take out the sum paid in, if it be a reasonable sum, whereas, if he goes on and gets a smaller sum, he will be penalised wholly or to some extent in costs. Once, therefore, the money has been paid in, the lis between the parties simply is: is that sum sufficient to cover the damage which has been suffered. Prima facie, therefore, the defendants in the present case are entitled to be paid their costs as from the date of payment in. But, of course, as in other cases, there may be circumstances connected with the case which entitled the judge to make some order other than that of giving the successful litigant his costs, and counsel for the plaintiff submitted that there were such circumstances in this case."
That passage has been reflected in the Rules of the Supreme Court. It has been submitted on behalf of the defendants that the prima facie rule must apply; and it is submitted by Mr Kemp on behalf of the claimant that there were the special circumstances to which Somervell LJ made reference, which justified the judge in departing from the general rule.

 
Mr Browne also referred us to a recent case, Ford v GKR Construction and Others the judgment being given on 22nd October 1999 in Cardiff and reported in the Times on 5th November 1999. The appeal heard by the Master of the Rolls, Pill LJ and Judge LJ was an appeal in relation to costs. It was a case in which a payment into court had been made. The claimant failed to beat the payment in but the judge ordered that the defendant should nonetheless pay the claimant's costs, the Court holding that in the particular circumstances of that case the judge was entitled to make the order that he did. That case is relied upon by Mr Kemp. However, Mr Browne submits, rightly in my judgment, that there are clear distinctions to be drawn between Ford and the instant case. In Ford the hearing was adjourned, and in the course of the adjournment the defendants instructed an  inquiry agent who took a video recording of the claimant; that video recording entirely changing the nature of the case. When the video recording was disclosed to the claimant and her advisors she then tried to settle the action but was unsuccessful in doing so. In those circumstances, this Court held that the judge was entitled to exercise his discretion in the way in which he did, but as I have indicated, the present case is quite different from that case.

 
Mr Browne then submits, however, that the only special circumstance which arose in this case is that a consultant psychiatrist was instructed by the defendants who came to the conclusion that the claimant was malingering. Mr Browne points to the fact that that doctor was not called to give evidence. He submits that the mere serving of a medical report containing that allegation cannot be a special circumstance which would justify the judge in departing from the usual rule that if a claimant fails to beat a payment into court then he or she must pay the costs as from the date of the payment in.

 
Mr Browne then points to the fact that Dr Jawad's report was prepared on 11th April 1998 and served on the  claimant and his advisors shortly thereafter, with the result that he and his advisors had full knowledge of the allegations that were contained in the report when the decision was made not to accept the money which had been paid into court within the period of 21 days allowed by the rules for such acceptance. Mr Browne then finally submitted, again with some justification, that a payment into court of this magnitude indicated that the defendants appreciated that the allegation of malingering was one which was unlikely to succeed. Mr Kemp, in an admirably succinct submission, said this was a case where the judge heard the evidence and was exercising a discretion, and he exercised that discretion on proper and appropriate grounds in the course of the judgment of which I have read.

 
The appropriate principles to be followed in considering an award of costs after a payment into court are set out in a judgment given by this Court on 13th October 1999 in Jones v Jones. On page 19 of the judgment Chadwick LJ said in relation to the provisions of the Rules:

 
"The scheme of those provisions is clear. Money may be paid in at any time. In particular, it may be paid in before the disclosure of the witness statements and expert reports on which the defendant will rely; and so, before the plaintiff knows the full extent of the defendant's case. The plaintiff has 21 days in which to decide whether to take the payment out of court. If the plaintiff decides to do that, it can be done without  leave. The plaintiff makes that decision on the basis of his assessment, under advice and on the materials then available of the risk of failing to obtain an award of damages greater than the amount of the payment in court. If the plaintiff decides not to accept the payment in within the 21 day period, then he cannot accept it without leave. But it is always open to him to reassess the risk in the light of anything which subsequently emerges in the course of the proceedings, including anything which emerges in the course of the trial. In particular, the plaintiff can reassess the risk in the light of witness statements and experts' reports which are disclosed by the defendant after the date of the payment in." 
As I have already said, the claimant in this case was in possession of Dr Jawad's report prior to the payment in. He was fully aware as of the date of the payment in of all the risks that were involved in the litigation. The issue that arose in this case for the judge's decision was the amount of money that should be awarded to the claimant in the action. There were, of course, as is always the case in a complex personal injury case, a number of sub-issues, including the suggestion of malingering; but all those matters in this case were subsidiary to the primary issue. In a personal injury case, in particular one involving alleged psychological damage, a number of factual issues are likely to arise on some of which the claimant may succeed and on some of which the defendants may succeed. However, in the great majority of cases, those issues form a part of the evidential pattern leading to an overall conclusion as  to the amount of money that the claimant recovers. It is, in my judgment, unusual to deprive a defendant who has paid a sum of money into court well in excess of the claim of any part of his costs because he was unsuccessful on a particular evidential issue, although it may be open to the Court to deprive that party of the costs relating to the issue itself. In the same way it would be unusual to deprive a claimant of his costs in a personal injury claim if he had beaten the payment into court but had not been successful on certain evidential issues.

 
Bearing in mind the way in which the judge arrived at his conclusion on the costs issue, it is perhaps worthy of note that the question of malingering is not mentioned in the judge's primary judgment at all; that is not surprising when it was not pursued by the defendants at the conclusion of the claimant's cross-examination.

 
The judge based his order (at least in part) on the concept that the claimant had to come to court to fight off the allegation that he was a malingerer. There is no evidence at all, and indeed it is unlikely to be the fact that the claimant came to court in order to defeat  that allegation, save in the sense that it was necessary to do so in order to recover the damages claimed by him. There is no evidence that he came to court to maintain his good character as opposed to recovering the sum of damages which he considered he was entitled to recover. He did not, for example - and not surprisingly  - through his solicitors, write to the defendants saying that he would accept the money on offer if the allegation of malingering was withdrawn. I have little doubt that if that offer had been proposed it would have been accepted.

 
In a personal injury action of this kind where there is a substantial claim for loss of earnings based substantially on psychological damage, it is, in my judgment, plain beyond peradventure that the issues such as the stress imposed by personal relationships, the claimant's ability to run a business on his own, the problems that arose in the financial services sector at the material time, would all be at the centre of the debate, as indeed they were at the centre of the evidence and at the centre of the judge's findings, which resulted in the claimant's failure to beat the payment into court. As the judge said the claimant and his advisors ought to have appreciated that they must  prove that his symptoms and his financial losses were caused by the accident. In my view, Mr Browne is right in submitting, on the basis of the judge's primary judgment, that the real issue in this case was one of causation. It was necessary for the claimant to prove that his losses resulted from the accident, and he failed to do so to the extent of recovering more than the payment into court.

 
I understand the judge's feelings of sympathy towards this claimant, but, in my view, the fact that, in a medical report the defendants made an allegation that the claimant was malingering, is not of itself sufficient to permit the judge to depart from the normal rule as to costs following a payment into court. In the well known case of In Re Elgindata Ltd 2 [1992] 1 WLR at 1207, this Court held that the general rule that costs should follow the event unless there were circumstances suggesting some other order should be made did not cease to apply merely because a successful party had raised issues or made allegations which he had failed to establish at the hearing of the action; a successful party to an action would not have acted improperly or unreasonably in raising issues, and if he had not done that he ought not to be ordered to pay any part of the  unsuccessful party's costs. It does not seem to me, in the circumstances that arose in this case, that it could be said that the defendants had acted improperly or unreasonably in raising the issues that they did. The facts of Elgindata were very different of course to the facts of the present case; but the principle is the same.

 
In this case, by reason of the payment in the defendants had become the successful party and "the event" was the failure of the claimant to recover more than the payment in. I have no doubt that the judge did have, as I have said, considerable sympathy with this seriously injured claimant when he appreciated that his order meant that the claimant had failed to beat the payment in, with the result that he had to pay all the costs since the date of the payment in, and there would be little, if anything, left for him. I share that sympathy. I also, if I may say so, sympathise with the judge's approach to the costs issue. However, I am wholly persuaded that in this case the judge did fall into error and has been shown to have been wrong. The judge is very experienced in this field, and I stress again as I did at the outset of this judgment, that he both heard the evidence and was exercising a discretion. However, I am persuaded  that there was no proper basis in this particular case upon which to depart from the general rule that if a claimant fails to beat the payment into court then the defendants should be entitled to their costs as from that date. Accordingly I would allow the appeal.

 
LORD JUSTICE CHADWICK:  I agree.

 
There is no dispute as to the principles which govern the award of costs in a case in which there has been a payment into court of an amount which exceeds the amount of the damages and interest to which the claimant is held to be entitled after trial. Put shortly, from the date of the payment in, or more accurately, from a date which will usually be 21 days after the date of the payment in, the claimant pursues his action on the basis that, if he does not beat the payment in, he will be treated, for the purposes of the Court's discretion as to costs, as if he were the loser. The consequence is that, applying the general principle that costs follow the event, it will be appropriate to make an order that the claimant pays the costs after that date, unless it appears to the Court that in the circumstances of the particular case some other order should be made as to the whole or any part of those costs.

 
The judge took the view that there were circumstances which enabled him to make some order other than an order which reflected the fact that the claimant had pursued a claim after a date when he could have taken out of court more than the amount to which he was eventually held to be entitled. The judge took that view on the basis that the claimant was facing a serious allegation that he was a malingerer, which he was entitled to meet and defend at a trial. In a passage to which Swinton Thomas LJ has already referred, the judge said this:

 
"I think that it is just that my order in the matter of costs should reflect the fact that this charge was made in a very serious and direct way; that it was sustained up to the trial; and that in the event it was rejected by me, no evidence having been called to support it. I do not feel that it would be just that a plaintiff who has come to trial, of course in order to secure a damages award but also to fight off the allegation made, should end up having to bear the entire costs of the action in circumstances where, although he has failed to beat the payment in, he left court without any stigma of malingering of a kind which had been levelled against him." 
The judge must have intended to refer in that passage to the liability to pay the costs of the action after the payment in, rather than "the entire costs of the action."  There was never any suggestion that the claimant should not have the costs of the action up to the time of her payment in.

 
The allegation of malingering was an allegation with which this claimant was faced when he made the decision, following the payment in on 25th August 1998 of the final instalment by the defendants, to pursue the action. It is impossible to conclude that this decision to pursue her action, insofar as it was made on financial grounds alone, would have been different if the claimant had known in August 1998, or thereafter, that the allegation of malingering would not be pursued. The chances of recovering were reduced, not increased, by the existence of an allegation of malingering. So an actual decision to pursue the action in circumstances in which the allegation was being made is consistent only with a putative decision to pursue the action if the allegation was not being made - at least if the two decisions are treated as made on financial grounds. The claimant cannot be heard to say that the hurdles which he had to surmount were increased by anything which happened after the payment in. In fact, the hurdles diminished, in that the allegation of malingering was not pursued at the trial.

 
The judge's approach leads, I think, to the conclusion that there was nothing that the defendant could do by way of payment in to prevent this trial proceeding. No matter how large the amount that was paid in, the  defendants could not protect themselves against the risk of having to bear its own costs of the trial. It could do so only by withdrawing Dr Jawad's report or any reliance upon it.

 
The claimant's difficulty, as it seems to me, is that he never suggested that Dr Jawad's report was the reason why he was pursuing his claim. The defendants were entitled to take the view that the claim was being pursued for the reason that personal injury claims are usually pursued; namely, in order to obtain an award of damages. Had the defendants been told that the claimant was content with the amount on offer, but was pursuing the claim only in order to obtain a retraction of Dr Jawad's report, the defendants would have been in a position to take appropriate steps. But that was never made clear to the defendants; and in those circumstances it seems to me that there was no reason why the claimant should not bear the ordinary risk, namely, the risk of having to pay the defendants' costs if he pursued a damages claim after a payment into court of a substantial amount.

 
I am conscious, as this Court must always be conscious, of the importance of respecting the exercise of the  trial judge's discretion in relation to costs; particularly in circumstances where the trial judge has had the advantage of a much clearer understanding than an appellate court can have of the factors which affected the course of the litigation which he tried. But in my view, the reason which the judge gave for departing from the ordinary rule as to the award of costs in these cases is one which cannot be supported.

 
In those circumstances it seems to me that this Court is required to set aside the judge's order; and is entitled to exercise its own discretion.

 
For those reasons I, too, would allow this appeal.

 
LORD JUSTICE CLARKE:  I agree that this appeal should be allowed although I have perhaps found the case more difficult than my Lords. The relevant principles have most recently been set out in the judgment of my Lord, Chadwick LJ, in Jones v Jones (unreported) on 13th October 1999 and in the other cases to which my Lord, Swinton Thomas LJ has referred. The judge expressed the principles in this way:

 
"It is well known that a plaintiff who fails to beat the payment in should pay the defendant's costs from the date of payment in unless there is some good reason to depart from the ordinary rule. Whether there is a  sufficient justification to depart from that rule is a matter which lies in the discretion of the judge. Like all judicial discretions, it has to be exercised on the facts of the individual case, but recognising that the general rule should not be departed from save for good reason."
To my mind that statement of principle is correct. The question for the judge was whether there was good reason to depart from the general rule on the facts of the instant case. That depends on all the circumstances of the case as they appeared to the judge when he was asked to exercise his discretion. Those circumstances can, in my judgment, include events after the date of payment of the payment in. For example, they can include the way in which the defendants conducted the case, including the trial.

 
In the instance case, the judge, who of course had the great advantage of having presided over the trial, took account, amongst other things, of the following facts. The defendants served the opinion of Dr Jawad which included a statement of his view that the respondent was a malingerer. That opinion was sent to the judge before the trial, presumably on the basis that it was evidence upon which the defendants intended to rely. That is plain from the fact that they relied upon that report in their skeleton argument which was also put before the  judge. Some of the contents of the report were put to the plaintiff in cross-examination. The word "malingerer" was not used, but some of the answers which he had given to Dr Jawad were put to him. He said that he had become upset. This exchange then occurred:

 
"Q. You say you became upset. In what
way did you become upset?
A. Because I couldn't answer the questions. (Witness upset).
Q. So you are saying, are you, that youranswers were influenced by the fact  that you were very upset rather than being true attempts to answer the questions?
A. No, I really tried to answer the  questions but they just became so complicated. I just could not answerthem and by the time you finished with  me I couldn't -- I just -- I was so ashamed that I could not answer the  questions and when I walked out ofthere I just felt like nothing.
Q. You were sure that that is the explanation rather than an attempt toplay up the symptoms as best you could, Mr Jawad?
A. No, no. "
After the cross-examination the judge was informed that the defendants would not rely upon Dr Jawad's report.

 
In reaching his conclusion on costs, the judge, in passages to which my Lords have variously referred, said this:

 
"What is the just cause for me to take?  I think that it is just that my order in the matter of costs should reflect the fact that this charge was made in a very serious and direct way; that is was sustained up to trial; and that in the event it was rejected by me, no evidences having been called to support it. I do not  feel that it would be just that a plaintiff who has come to trial, of course in order to secure a damages award but also to fight off the allegation made, should end up having to bear the entire costs of the action in circumstances where, although he has failed to beat the payment in, he has left court without any stigma of malingering of a kind which had been levelled against him.
Secondly, I do not think that the plaintiff and his advisers ought to have failed to realise their need to prove that the symptoms were due to the accident, but I do have a measure of sympathy with him and his advisers when it is said that the whole way in which the case was viewed prior to trial in the light of the psychiatric evidence disclosed by the defendants was different from the way in which the trial in fact went. It often happens that trials go differently from the way in which they have been anticipated; but where that is caused in part by one party launching a particular form of attack of a grave kind, which is then not carried through or fails, that is something which the Court can and should justly bear in mind when deciding where the costs ought to lie.
I think that the plaintiff asks too much when he asks that he should have the costs of the action. That fails to reflect the fact that he has failed to beat the payment in which, on sober analysis, ought to have been accepted. But looking at the matter in quite broad terms, and asking myself what I think is fair, I think that fairness and justice would be done on the special facts of this case if I make no order as to the costs from the date of the payment in."
The question is whether the exercise of the judge's discretion in that way was plainly wrong in the light of the relevant principles. The judge would, in my opinion, have been entitled to deprive the defendants of the costs of instructing Dr Jawad and in particular of the costs relevant to the allegation that the respondent was a malingerer. He could, in my judgment, have done  so consistently with the principles in In Re Elgindata Ltd (No.2) [1992] 1 WLR 1207 per Nourse LJ at 1214.

 
The question is whether it was outside the permissible exercise of the judge's discretion to deprive the defendants of all their costs after the payment in, or, more accurately, after 21 days from the payment in. I have reached the conclusion that it was. There is no evidence that one of the causes of the respondent proceeding with its case after the payment in was the allegation of malingering. If the judge reached a different conclusion in any of the passages quoted above I regret that I am unable to agree with him.

 
The respondent's object in pressing the matter to trial was, in my judgment, plainly to try to obtain more than the £220,000 paid into court. The defendants were thus bound to incur substantial costs as a result of the respondent's decision to reject the payment in and to fight for more. Quite apart from the evidence of Dr Jawad and the issue of malingering, that decision inevitably led to the defendants incurring very substantial costs. In these circumstances, I do not see how the allegation of malingering, if I may so describe it, could possibly justify depriving the defendants of  all their costs. In these circumstances, the exercise by the judge of his discretion by depriving the defendants of all their costs was outside the permissible range of the exercise of that discretion. For this reason I agree that the appeal should be allowed. As I see it, the question which will now arise is how this Court should exercise its discretion, given the conclusions reached by the judge.

 
(Appeal allowed with costs as from 21 days after payment in. Defendants will not recover any costs incurred in relation to Dr Jawad or in relation to the malingering issue).
