[
Sir James Munby, President of the Family Division : 
This is an appeal from an order of Her Honour Judge George, who was sitting in the Family Court at Leicester hearing care proceedings in relation to a little girl, B, who was born in the spring of 2016. B has an elder full brother, H, who was born in 2015. He was adopted in 2016. The essential issue before Judge George was whether B should be placed with H's adoptive parents or with her father's cousin, I, and her partner R. Judge George gave judgment and made her order on 21 August 2017. She made care and placement orders with a view to B's adoption by H's adoptive parents. 
 
B's father sought permission to appeal, which was granted by McFarlane LJ on 13 October 2017. He observed that the appeal raises an important point of principle. The appeal is supported by B's mother and by I and R; it is opposed by the local authority and by B's children's guardian. The appeal came on before us on 23 November 2017. B's father was represented by Ms Sarah Morgan QC and Ms Olivia Magennis, B's mother by Ms Charlotte Georges, I and R by Ms Deirdre Fottrell QC and Ms Louise MacLynn, the local authority by Mr Martin Kingerley, and B's guardian by Mr Will Tyler QC and Ms Emily James. At the end of the hearing we reserved judgment.
 
The point of principle referred to by McFarlane LJ, and which has been the focus of the excellent submissions we have had the pleasure of reading and hearing, relates to the ramifications of the decision of this court in Re T (A Child) (Early Permanence Placement) [2015] EWCA Civ 983, [2017] 1 FLR 330. Before going any further, and the better to put the key passages in Judge George's judgment in context, it is convenient to examine the decision in Re T, a case in which, as it happens, I gave the only judgment.
 
I start with this (Re T, para 43):
 
"From the very earliest days of the 1989 Act  the court has set its face against the joinder in care proceedings of foster parents or prospective adopters. Two decisions of this court explain why."
That was a reference to the decisions of this court in Re G (Minors) (Interim Care Order) [1993] 2 FLR 839 and in Re A; Coventry County Council v CC and A [2007] EWCA Civ 1383, [2008] 1 FLR 959. 
The central principle was explained in the latter case by Wilson LJ (Re A, para 24):
 
"The application for a placement order required the magistrates to consider the principle whether the best interests of A required that she be adopted but not to determine the identity of the optimum adoptive home for her."
   He continued (para 34):
"I do not agree with the judge that the proper forum for consideration of the identity of the optimum adopter or adopters for a child is the court which makes the care and placement orders. For, in terms of the adoption of the child and in contradistinction to the child's committal into care, the placement order is not the court's last word. Its last word is articulated when the adoption order is made; and any court which makes a placement order knows that any issue in relation to the identity of the optimum adopter or adopters of the child can be ventilated in an application for an adoption order  As a judge of the family justice system for almost 15 years, I have never encountered a case in which an aspiring adopter participated in the hearing of proceedings relating to whether a child should be placed for adoption, or should be freed for adoption under the old law set out in s 18 of the Adoption Act 1976. For the law provides a forum in which issues as to the identity of the optimum adopter can later be ventilated. In my view, therefore, the requirement for close scrutiny of the care plan should in principle not extend to an address of any issue as to the identity of the optimum adopter or adopters for the child."
I said much the same in Re T, para 50:
 
"The care judge is concerned at most with consideration of adoption in principle, not with evaluating the merits of particular proposed adopters. There is no need for the prospective adopters to be joined, for it is the children's guardian  who has the task, indeed is under the duty, of subjecting the local authority's care plan to rigorous scrutiny and, where appropriate, criticism."
I went on to recognise (Re T, para 51) that there might be "an exceptional case justifying [a] departure from the general approach", echoing in this respect what Wilson LJ had said in Re A, para 35:
 
"To say that the credentials of proposed adopters may exceptionally need to be considered in care proceedings in order that the court should better be able to reach the central decision whether the child should be removed from his family and adopted is not to say that care or indeed placement proceedings are an appropriate forum for resolution of an issue between a proposed adopter and the local authority as to the merits of her candidacy."
Waite LJ had similarly qualified the general principle when in Re G (page 846) he contrasted what was "normally" appropriate in "ordinary circumstances" with the circumstances in Re G itself, which he described as being "exceptional  with many unusual features." 
Her Honour Judge George, in a careful and detailed judgment to which I wish to pay deserved tribute, appropriately and correctly directed herself by reference to the relevant provisions of the Children Act 1989 and the Adoption and Children Act 2002 and to the judgments of the Supreme Court in Re B [2013] UKSC 33 and of this court in Re B-S [2013] EWCA Civ 1146, Re R [2016] EWCA Civ 1625 and Re W [2016] EWCA Civ 793. She also recognised that Article 8 was engaged, acknowledging the application of the principle of proportionality and (judgment, para 14) that the court "should make no more interventionist an order than is necessary to meet the needs of the child." There was, and could be, no criticism of that part of her judgment.
 
Turning to consider Re T, Judge George said this (judgment, paras 19-21):
 
"19	 That was a case where the potential adopters had also been the child's foster carers for a period of time and they sought to be made parties to proceedings. The court found that it was not necessary for the prospective adopters to be joined, they had already been positively assessed, and cautioned against, in a case such as that one, allowing the process to become a dispute between prospective adopters and the birth family, "lest the court be diverted into an illegitimate enquiry as to which placement will be better for the child because that is not the question before the court."
20		This case can be distinguished from that one because [B] has no existing relationship with the proposed adopters as existed between the child and prospective adopters in Re T. I have to determine this case in the knowledge that the prospective adopters for [B] care for her full sibling brother. To the extent that fact is known, a degree of comparison between the options before the court is unavoidable in seeking to establish what [B]'s welfare needs are and how they can best be met. That inevitably happens when the court weighs up the pros and cons of each option. However, as I hope this judgement will show, it is the principle of adoption that the court is considering in the particular facts of this case, not choosing the better of two alternative placements.
21		The local authority asserts that, all things being equal as to the quality of each placement, [B]'s welfare throughout her life lies with her being brought up with her brother. At the pre-placement stage the court is still considering adoption in principle, in this case in the knowledge that the prospective adopters care for [H]. In weighing the pros and cons of each option the court must steer a course between the known fact that [H] has already been placed for adoption and trying to avoid it being a competition between two possible placements. The court must undertake the necessary balancing exercise, but in the knowledge that the adoption placement whilst still being considered in principle holds [H]. That is the approach I have attempted to take in this case."
The judge continued (paras 25-27):
 
"25	There is no authority on all fours with this case where a sibling is already placed with prospective adopters. The case law, in my judgment, whilst making clear that the placement options are not to be seen as in competition requires the court to carry out a holistic global analysis of the pros and cons of each option. The adoption option in this case cannot ignore the fact that if placed with adopters [B] will be living with a full sibling. Beyond that fact the court seeks to resist being drawn into a comparison between the two placements and certainly is not asking the question of which is the better placement.  
26		The question in this case is whether there is an over-riding requirement pertaining to [B]'s best interests which makes adoption the right outcome for her, despite the positive assessment and viable option of a placement within the family.  The social worker, IRO and Guardian are all of the view that the benefits of [B] growing up with a full sibling outweigh the benefits of a family placement.  
27		The question, therefore, is one of weight to be attached to the competing pros and cons of each option, whether on analysis the court concludes, as the local authority and Guardian invite it to, that [B]'s welfare interests throughout her life require her to be placed for adoption and outweigh other considerations.  The pros and cons of the two realistic options involve an analysis of the placement with [I] and [R], what life would be like with them, the extent to which relationships with the birth family and the quality and nature of them would be maintained. The pros and cons of an adoptive placement must be considered in the context where two siblings would be placed together, even though they have no existing relationship, but where the social worker and Guardian say the enduring and lifelong nature of the sibling relationship is of such importance as to lead the court to conclude adoption is necessary. Specifically the court will need to carefully consider s1(4)(c) and (f) of the welfare checklist in the ACA 2002."
Those sections provide as follows:
 
"The court  must have regard to the following matters (among others)  

(c)	the likely effect on the child (throughout his life) of having ceased to be a member of the original family and become an adopted person,

(f)		the relationship which the child has with relatives, and with any other person in relation to whom the court  considers the relationship to be relevant, including  
(i)		the likelihood of any such relationship continuing and the value to the child of its doing so,
(ii)	the ability and willingness of any of the child's relatives, or of any such person, to provide the child with a secure environment in which the child can develop, and otherwise to meet the child's needs,
(iii)	the wishes and feelings of any of the child's relatives, or of any such person, regarding the child."
The judge next embarked upon a careful analysis of the evidence (judgment, paras 28-35). It requires to be read in full, but for present purposes I can concentrate on the evidence of the children's guardian, which the judge described (para 34) as "very thoughtful". She continued (paras 34-35):
 
"34	 She said that placement with [R] and [I] is a realistic option, they are an open and generous couple, but her professional judgment is that the advantages for [B] of a full sibling relationship outweigh the advantages of a placement with [R] and [I].  
35		She was careful to point out that her recommendation did not turn on an assessment of [I] and [R], but the weight to be attached to the two competing factors set out in Sections 1(4)(c) and (f) of the 2002 Act. She had balanced on the one hand the effect of [B] having ceased to be a member of her original birth family mitigated in this case by the big plus of a lifelong relationship with her full sibling and closest relative and, on the other hand, the relationships she has with her relatives, the likelihood of those relationships continuing and the value to the child in them doing so. If [H] had not already been placed for adoption in a placement willing to take [B], the Guardian would support a placement with [I] and [R]. It would have been under a Care Order because currently the placement is untested. That would result in a period of uncertainty for [B]. Taking into account the research on the importance of the sibling bond and all the circumstances of this case she attached more weight to the sibling relationship, which led her to conclude that adoption was necessary."
The judge thus correctly recognised (paras 26, 34) that a family placement with I and R was a viable and realistic option. In that context, it is important to appreciate the point made by McFarlane LJ in Re W (A Child) [2016] EWCA Civ 793, paras 70-71:
 
"70	With respect to them, it is clear to me that both the Children's Guardian and the ISW fell into serious error by misunderstanding the need to evaluate the question of A's future welfare by affording due weight to all of the relevant factors and without applying any automatic "presumption" or "right" for a child to be brought up by a member of her natural family. The extracts from the reports of both of these witnesses indicate that they determined their recommendation for A on just that basis. Mrs Fairbairn repeatedly described the child as having a "right" to be brought up by the natural family where there is a viable placement available. The Guardian advised that adoption is not in A's best interests because the grandparents can provide her with a home. Putting the correct position in lay terms, the existence of a viable home with the grandparents should make that option "a runner" but should not automatically make it "a winner" in the absence of full consideration of any other factor that is relevant to her welfare; the error of the ISW and the Guardian appears to have been to hold that "if a family placement is a 'runner', then it has to be regarded as a 'winner'". 
71		The repeated reference to a 'right' for a child to be brought up by his or her natural family, or the assumption that there is a presumption to that effect, needs to be firmly and clearly laid to rest. No such 'right' or presumption exists. The only 'right' is for the arrangements for the child to be determined by affording paramount consideration to her welfare throughout her life (in an adoption case) in a manner which is proportionate and compatible with the need to respect any ECHR Art 8 rights which are engaged."
Judge George then turned, first (paras 36-46), to an analysis of the "advantages of the kinship placement" and, second (paras 47-55), to an analysis of the "disadvantages of a kinship placement".  In relation to the first, it is important to note the judge's finding (para 40) that "the issues raised are resolvable and not major concerns. They have not been sufficient to cause anyone to ask the court to rule out [I] and [R] as potential carers for [B]." In relation to the second, the judge said (paras 47-48) that:
 
"47	The disadvantages of a placement with [I] and [R] are that, first of all, it is an untested placement in which there is an element of uncertainty. It would be necessary for [B] to be placed with them under a Care order for at least 12 months with a view to proceedings then being brought for a Special Guardianship order. This means a delay in the permanency and making of final orders for [B] and that further proceedings would be necessary. There would continue to be local authority involvement in [B]'s life for a period of time.  
48		It is also right to acknowledge that [I] and [R]'s family situation is facing a number of changes and whilst the significance of these must not be exaggerated and there is no reason to suppose that they will not manage them they are nevertheless changes that everyone will have to adapt to and introduce an element of uncertainty."
The judge then set out (paras 56-62) her analysis of the "pros and cons of an adoptive placement." She began with this (paras 56-57):
 
"56	One advantage of adoption is that [B] will be brought up with her nearest relative, a full sibling. This would mean that she would never be alone, she would have the shared experiences of being brought up in the same household, which will promote identity and self-esteem. The research which I have been referred to suggests that the sibling relationship is emotionally powerful and critically important, not only in childhood but over the course of a lifetime. People spend more time with their siblings than anyone else. Growing up with a sibling enables one to learn social skills, sharing and managing conflict and negotiating. The relationship can provide a significant source of continuity throughout a child's lifetime and is likely to be the longest relationship most people experience.  
57		For children going into care it is generally accepted that siblings should be placed together unless it is contrary to an individual child's welfare needs. A shared history and experiences help self-identity and self-esteem because siblings provide support and companionship. An adoptive placement with her brother would mitigate against the loss of the relationship with her parents. This would be a lifelong relationship with her brother which would be promoted. The impact of becoming an adopted person, with the severance of legal and emotional ties with her parents and family, would also be mitigated by the shared experience of being with her brother."
As against that (para 61):
 
"The disadvantages of an adoption placement include severance of the links with the biological family. This can mean a real sense of loss, particularly to children when they get older and realise that they have not brought up within their biological family. It can also have a negative impact on their sense of identity and belonging. It will result in a loss of [B]'s relationship with her parents because there would be no direct contact with them. There would be a probable loss of contact with the extended family because it is unlikely that [B] will have contact with her half-siblings or with [I] and [R] and their family."
The judge concluded with a section (paras 63-69) headed "Decision." She began (paras 63-64):
 
"63	In the final analysis the court must decide whether the advantages associated with the sibling relationship outweigh the relationship with other family members: the parents, half-siblings, [I] and the wider family. This is the balancing exercise between the factors set out in Sections 1(4)(c) and (f) of the 2002 Act. I have already set out the benefits of the sibling relationship. Although there is no existing relationship between the siblings once the children are living in the same household one is likely to develop rapidly, given their closeness in age. I acknowledge the argument that to prioritise the relationship with a brother will be at the expense of all other family relationships. They do not have an existing relationship which can currently be given weight to, but rather the potential for a unique relationship lasting throughout their lives which the Guardian and social worker say should be prioritised.  
64		The reality and quality of a continuing relationship with other family members is very relevant here therefore. As I have identified already, the relationship with her parents is likely to be very limited. [Her father] is likely to be in [Africa], so contact will be indirect with possible occasional visits to [Africa]  Contact with the mother is likely to be either non-existent or problematic and potentially disruptive and unsettling. [B] has no existing relationship with her half-siblings, but only the potential for one. That is likely to be very limited. Those children are all quite a bit older than her and may or may not develop a bond."
She continued (paras 66-67):
 
"66	When considering [B]'s welfare throughout her life the scales tip in favour of prioritising the relationship with her brother for all the positive advantages that will bring her set out above. What makes this case particularly difficult and finely balanced is the cultural dimension. However, a close examination of what benefits [B] would actually derive from a placement with [I] and [R] reveals that [and she then set out various matters which I do not propose to repeat as they might lead to the identification of the family. She went on:] The practicalities and financial cost of frequent visits to [Africa] may prove problematic.  
67		Whilst a placement with [H] does not provide the cultural match which a placement with [I] could offer, the adopters have some cultural similarities and living with her brother would boost her identity because of growing up with her closest relative. His heritage and identity and early childhood experience of a foster placement at birth and then one stable placement afterwards, exactly mirrors her own. All this has led me to conclude that this is the over-riding requirement pertaining to [B]'s best interests throughout her life. Having reached that conclusion, I am satisfied that an adoption order is necessary to meet [B]'s needs and proportionate in all the circumstances of the case."
The judge concluded as follows (paras 68-69):
 
"68	Whilst this is more interventionist than a placement with [I] and [R], it has the benefit of permanency now. There will be no further delay. It will avoid the testing out of a placement with [I] and [R] and reduce the risks and uncertainties for [B] all of which adds weight to the decision that I have come to.  
69		So the order that I make is for a Care and Placement order and the parents' consent be dispensed with on the grounds that her welfare requires it."
I have deliberately set out the key passages in the judgment at some length for two reasons. First, because they bring out very clearly the judge's careful, thoughtful and nuanced approach. Secondly, because, at the end of the day, I am satisfied that her findings, her reasoning and her conclusions were plainly open to her on the totality of the evidence and other materials before her. They are, in my judgment, unassailable.
 
The father's grounds of appeal are, in essence, two-fold:
 
i)	The first complaint (ground 1) is that the judge erred in allowing her decision to become a competition between the adopters and the kinship carers. She was thus, it is said, drawn into assessing competing options without essential information about one of the options, with the consequence that her assessment was unfair and her order disproportionate.
ii)	The second complaint relates to the judge's evaluation of the two options, each of which was realistic. It is said (ground 2) that the judge erred in prioritising B's relationship with H over her relationships with her wider family and in placing too much emphasis on the sibling relationship; that (ground 3) she placed too much weight on the 'untested' nature of the placement with I and R while failing to acknowledge that the placement with H's adopters was equally untested; and that (ground 4) she was too focused on avoiding the potential delay and failed to balance the purpose of such delay to B's best interests.
In my judgment, none of these matters is made out and the appeal should accordingly be dismissed.
 
The central core of the father's complaint relates to the judge's application  in his counsel's submissions, her misapplication  of the principles in Re T, the essence of the complaint being that the judge had, in conflict with those principles, treated the matter as a competition between the adopters and the kinship carers and, illegitimately, been drawn into an inquiry as to which would be the 'better' placement. As the passages from her judgment (judgment, paras 20, 21 and 25) which I have set out demonstrate, that is not what the judge said she was doing or what she thought she was doing. Nor, in my judgment, is that what she was in fact doing. On the contrary, she was carefully, conscientiously and, in my judgment, correctly applying the learning in Re T.
 
How else was the judge to proceed? She was confronted with the fact  the reality  that B's only full sibling, H, a sibling close to her in age, had been adopted and that H's adoptive parents were willing to adopt B. That was not something the judge could ignore, as it were put out of her mind, if she was to comply with her statutory duty under section 1(4) and in particular section 1(4)(f) of the 2002 Act. And in having regard to that objective, factual, reality, the judge was doing nothing inconsistent with the learning in Re T and the earlier authorities to which I have referred. 
 
As Mr Tyler and Ms James pointedly observe, there is nothing in Re T to say that the court can ignore a crucial factor which is necessarily concomitant with a particular placement. The presence of H in B's life must fall in the credit side of the balance sheet in relation to placement with H's adopters, just as the loss of H must fall in the debit side in relation to the kinship placement; to ignore this would, they say, be a nonsense. I agree.   
 
Complaint is also made, in particular by Ms Fottrell and Ms MacLynn, that the judge never grappled with the question of whether adoption per se was required for B and, in consequence, that she truncated the adoption process and, in effect, approached the case as if she was deciding an adoption application and on the assumption that, immediately following the making of the placement order, B would be placed for adoption by H's adoptive parents. I do not agree. The judge was well aware that she was considering only the making (if appropriate) of care and placement orders as a prelude to the entirely separate adoption proceedings which, if she made those orders, would no doubt follow in due course. And, in circumstances where the fact and reality was that H had been adopted by those who were offering a similar placement for B, the distinction between adoption per se and adoption by H's adoptive parents is more apparent than real. 
 
The father complains that the process adopted by the judge meant that she ended up weighing the 'known' uncertainties in respect of the proposed kinship carers against the certainties of the adoptive placement. That, it is said, was an unfair half-way house; the judge, on this approach, should have embarked upon a full welfare evaluation and comparison of each prospective placement. I do not agree. The judge knew all that she needed to know about the possible placement with H's adoptive parents to be able properly to carry out, and in a manner compatible with Re T, the task she was embarked upon. Indeed, to go further into that aspect of the matter than she did would have risked offending against the principle in Re T. 
 
In relation to the other grounds of appeal I can be quite brief. The father complains that the judge erred in prioritising B's relationship with H over her relationships with her wider family, in placing too much emphasis on the sibling relationship, and in attaching too little weight to 'nothing else will do'. I do not agree. The judge did not prioritise either of these placements  both, it is to be noted, family placements  over the other. She treated each as being viable and realistic and carefully evaluated the competing evidence and arguments before coming to her conclusion. The fact that her conclusion favoured X rather than Y does not mean that the judge was prioritising X over Y. Her conclusion that, in all the circumstances, B's future relationship with H throughout their lives tipped the balance and was determinative of the outcome, was, in my judgment, securely founded in the evidence the judge had heard and, as I have already said, was plainly open to her.    
 
I can take the two remaining grounds  that the judge placed too much weight on the 'untested' nature of the placement with I and R while failing to acknowledge that the placement with H's adopters was equally untested; and that she was too focused on avoiding the potential delay and failed to balance the purpose of such delay to B's best interests  together. The judge, in my judgment, was entitled to have regard to these factors, and it was for her to determine how much weight to attach to them. In fact, as we have seen, she did not attribute determinative weight to other of them. As her judgment makes clear (judgment, para 68) their impact was merely to "add  weight to the decision that I have come to."
 
Lord Justice Davis :
I agree.
 
Lord Justice Underhill :
I also agree.

Sir James Munby, President of the Family Division : 
This is an appeal from an order of Her Honour Judge George, who was sitting in the Family Court at Leicester hearing care proceedings in relation to a little girl, B, who was born in the spring of 2016. B has an elder full brother, H, who was born in 2015. He was adopted in 2016. The essential issue before Judge George was whether B should be placed with H's adoptive parents or with her father's cousin, I, and her partner R. Judge George gave judgment and made her order on 21 August 2017. She made care and placement orders with a view to B's adoption by H's adoptive parents. 
 
B's father sought permission to appeal, which was granted by McFarlane LJ on 13 October 2017. He observed that the appeal raises an important point of principle. The appeal is supported by B's mother and by I and R; it is opposed by the local authority and by B's children's guardian. The appeal came on before us on 23 November 2017. B's father was represented by Ms Sarah Morgan QC and Ms Olivia Magennis, B's mother by Ms Charlotte Georges, I and R by Ms Deirdre Fottrell QC and Ms Louise MacLynn, the local authority by Mr Martin Kingerley, and B's guardian by Mr Will Tyler QC and Ms Emily James. At the end of the hearing we reserved judgment.
 
The point of principle referred to by McFarlane LJ, and which has been the focus of the excellent submissions we have had the pleasure of reading and hearing, relates to the ramifications of the decision of this court in Re T (A Child) (Early Permanence Placement) [2015] EWCA Civ 983, [2017] 1 FLR 330. Before going any further, and the better to put the key passages in Judge George's judgment in context, it is convenient to examine the decision in Re T, a case in which, as it happens, I gave the only judgment.
 
I start with this (Re T, para 43):
 
"From the very earliest days of the 1989 Act  the court has set its face against the joinder in care proceedings of foster parents or prospective adopters. Two decisions of this court explain why."
That was a reference to the decisions of this court in Re G (Minors) (Interim Care Order) [1993] 2 FLR 839 and in Re A; Coventry County Council v CC and A [2007] EWCA Civ 1383, [2008] 1 FLR 959. 
The central principle was explained in the latter case by Wilson LJ (Re A, para 24):
 
"The application for a placement order required the magistrates to consider the principle whether the best interests of A required that she be adopted but not to determine the identity of the optimum adoptive home for her."
   He continued (para 34):
"I do not agree with the judge that the proper forum for consideration of the identity of the optimum adopter or adopters for a child is the court which makes the care and placement orders. For, in terms of the adoption of the child and in contradistinction to the child's committal into care, the placement order is not the court's last word. Its last word is articulated when the adoption order is made; and any court which makes a placement order knows that any issue in relation to the identity of the optimum adopter or adopters of the child can be ventilated in an application for an adoption order  As a judge of the family justice system for almost 15 years, I have never encountered a case in which an aspiring adopter participated in the hearing of proceedings relating to whether a child should be placed for adoption, or should be freed for adoption under the old law set out in s 18 of the Adoption Act 1976. For the law provides a forum in which issues as to the identity of the optimum adopter can later be ventilated. In my view, therefore, the requirement for close scrutiny of the care plan should in principle not extend to an address of any issue as to the identity of the optimum adopter or adopters for the child."
I said much the same in Re T, para 50:
 
"The care judge is concerned at most with consideration of adoption in principle, not with evaluating the merits of particular proposed adopters. There is no need for the prospective adopters to be joined, for it is the children's guardian  who has the task, indeed is under the duty, of subjecting the local authority's care plan to rigorous scrutiny and, where appropriate, criticism."
I went on to recognise (Re T, para 51) that there might be "an exceptional case justifying [a] departure from the general approach", echoing in this respect what Wilson LJ had said in Re A, para 35:
 
"To say that the credentials of proposed adopters may exceptionally need to be considered in care proceedings in order that the court should better be able to reach the central decision whether the child should be removed from his family and adopted is not to say that care or indeed placement proceedings are an appropriate forum for resolution of an issue between a proposed adopter and the local authority as to the merits of her candidacy."
Waite LJ had similarly qualified the general principle when in Re G (page 846) he contrasted what was "normally" appropriate in "ordinary circumstances" with the circumstances in Re G itself, which he described as being "exceptional  with many unusual features." 
Her Honour Judge George, in a careful and detailed judgment to which I wish to pay deserved tribute, appropriately and correctly directed herself by reference to the relevant provisions of the Children Act 1989 and the Adoption and Children Act 2002 and to the judgments of the Supreme Court in Re B [2013] UKSC 33 and of this court in Re B-S [2013] EWCA Civ 1146, Re R [2016] EWCA Civ 1625 and Re W [2016] EWCA Civ 793. She also recognised that Article 8 was engaged, acknowledging the application of the principle of proportionality and (judgment, para 14) that the court "should make no more interventionist an order than is necessary to meet the needs of the child." There was, and could be, no criticism of that part of her judgment.
 
Turning to consider Re T, Judge George said this (judgment, paras 19-21):
 
"19	 That was a case where the potential adopters had also been the child's foster carers for a period of time and they sought to be made parties to proceedings. The court found that it was not necessary for the prospective adopters to be joined, they had already been positively assessed, and cautioned against, in a case such as that one, allowing the process to become a dispute between prospective adopters and the birth family, "lest the court be diverted into an illegitimate enquiry as to which placement will be better for the child because that is not the question before the court."
20		This case can be distinguished from that one because [B] has no existing relationship with the proposed adopters as existed between the child and prospective adopters in Re T. I have to determine this case in the knowledge that the prospective adopters for [B] care for her full sibling brother. To the extent that fact is known, a degree of comparison between the options before the court is unavoidable in seeking to establish what [B]'s welfare needs are and how they can best be met. That inevitably happens when the court weighs up the pros and cons of each option. However, as I hope this judgement will show, it is the principle of adoption that the court is considering in the particular facts of this case, not choosing the better of two alternative placements.
21		The local authority asserts that, all things being equal as to the quality of each placement, [B]'s welfare throughout her life lies with her being brought up with her brother. At the pre-placement stage the court is still considering adoption in principle, in this case in the knowledge that the prospective adopters care for [H]. In weighing the pros and cons of each option the court must steer a course between the known fact that [H] has already been placed for adoption and trying to avoid it being a competition between two possible placements. The court must undertake the necessary balancing exercise, but in the knowledge that the adoption placement whilst still being considered in principle holds [H]. That is the approach I have attempted to take in this case."
The judge continued (paras 25-27):
 
"25	There is no authority on all fours with this case where a sibling is already placed with prospective adopters. The case law, in my judgment, whilst making clear that the placement options are not to be seen as in competition requires the court to carry out a holistic global analysis of the pros and cons of each option. The adoption option in this case cannot ignore the fact that if placed with adopters [B] will be living with a full sibling. Beyond that fact the court seeks to resist being drawn into a comparison between the two placements and certainly is not asking the question of which is the better placement.  
26		The question in this case is whether there is an over-riding requirement pertaining to [B]'s best interests which makes adoption the right outcome for her, despite the positive assessment and viable option of a placement within the family.  The social worker, IRO and Guardian are all of the view that the benefits of [B] growing up with a full sibling outweigh the benefits of a family placement.  
27		The question, therefore, is one of weight to be attached to the competing pros and cons of each option, whether on analysis the court concludes, as the local authority and Guardian invite it to, that [B]'s welfare interests throughout her life require her to be placed for adoption and outweigh other considerations.  The pros and cons of the two realistic options involve an analysis of the placement with [I] and [R], what life would be like with them, the extent to which relationships with the birth family and the quality and nature of them would be maintained. The pros and cons of an adoptive placement must be considered in the context where two siblings would be placed together, even though they have no existing relationship, but where the social worker and Guardian say the enduring and lifelong nature of the sibling relationship is of such importance as to lead the court to conclude adoption is necessary. Specifically the court will need to carefully consider s1(4)(c) and (f) of the welfare checklist in the ACA 2002."
Those sections provide as follows:
 
"The court  must have regard to the following matters (among others)  

(c)	the likely effect on the child (throughout his life) of having ceased to be a member of the original family and become an adopted person,

(f)		the relationship which the child has with relatives, and with any other person in relation to whom the court  considers the relationship to be relevant, including  
(i)		the likelihood of any such relationship continuing and the value to the child of its doing so,
(ii)	the ability and willingness of any of the child's relatives, or of any such person, to provide the child with a secure environment in which the child can develop, and otherwise to meet the child's needs,
(iii)	the wishes and feelings of any of the child's relatives, or of any such person, regarding the child."
The judge next embarked upon a careful analysis of the evidence (judgment, paras 28-35). It requires to be read in full, but for present purposes I can concentrate on the evidence of the children's guardian, which the judge described (para 34) as "very thoughtful". She continued (paras 34-35):
 
"34	 She said that placement with [R] and [I] is a realistic option, they are an open and generous couple, but her professional judgment is that the advantages for [B] of a full sibling relationship outweigh the advantages of a placement with [R] and [I].  
35		She was careful to point out that her recommendation did not turn on an assessment of [I] and [R], but the weight to be attached to the two competing factors set out in Sections 1(4)(c) and (f) of the 2002 Act. She had balanced on the one hand the effect of [B] having ceased to be a member of her original birth family mitigated in this case by the big plus of a lifelong relationship with her full sibling and closest relative and, on the other hand, the relationships she has with her relatives, the likelihood of those relationships continuing and the value to the child in them doing so. If [H] had not already been placed for adoption in a placement willing to take [B], the Guardian would support a placement with [I] and [R]. It would have been under a Care Order because currently the placement is untested. That would result in a period of uncertainty for [B]. Taking into account the research on the importance of the sibling bond and all the circumstances of this case she attached more weight to the sibling relationship, which led her to conclude that adoption was necessary."
The judge thus correctly recognised (paras 26, 34) that a family placement with I and R was a viable and realistic option. In that context, it is important to appreciate the point made by McFarlane LJ in Re W (A Child) [2016] EWCA Civ 793, paras 70-71:
 
"70	With respect to them, it is clear to me that both the Children's Guardian and the ISW fell into serious error by misunderstanding the need to evaluate the question of A's future welfare by affording due weight to all of the relevant factors and without applying any automatic "presumption" or "right" for a child to be brought up by a member of her natural family. The extracts from the reports of both of these witnesses indicate that they determined their recommendation for A on just that basis. Mrs Fairbairn repeatedly described the child as having a "right" to be brought up by the natural family where there is a viable placement available. The Guardian advised that adoption is not in A's best interests because the grandparents can provide her with a home. Putting the correct position in lay terms, the existence of a viable home with the grandparents should make that option "a runner" but should not automatically make it "a winner" in the absence of full consideration of any other factor that is relevant to her welfare; the error of the ISW and the Guardian appears to have been to hold that "if a family placement is a 'runner', then it has to be regarded as a 'winner'". 
71		The repeated reference to a 'right' for a child to be brought up by his or her natural family, or the assumption that there is a presumption to that effect, needs to be firmly and clearly laid to rest. No such 'right' or presumption exists. The only 'right' is for the arrangements for the child to be determined by affording paramount consideration to her welfare throughout her life (in an adoption case) in a manner which is proportionate and compatible with the need to respect any ECHR Art 8 rights which are engaged."
Judge George then turned, first (paras 36-46), to an analysis of the "advantages of the kinship placement" and, second (paras 47-55), to an analysis of the "disadvantages of a kinship placement".  In relation to the first, it is important to note the judge's finding (para 40) that "the issues raised are resolvable and not major concerns. They have not been sufficient to cause anyone to ask the court to rule out [I] and [R] as potential carers for [B]." In relation to the second, the judge said (paras 47-48) that:
 
"47	The disadvantages of a placement with [I] and [R] are that, first of all, it is an untested placement in which there is an element of uncertainty. It would be necessary for [B] to be placed with them under a Care order for at least 12 months with a view to proceedings then being brought for a Special Guardianship order. This means a delay in the permanency and making of final orders for [B] and that further proceedings would be necessary. There would continue to be local authority involvement in [B]'s life for a period of time.  
48		It is also right to acknowledge that [I] and [R]'s family situation is facing a number of changes and whilst the significance of these must not be exaggerated and there is no reason to suppose that they will not manage them they are nevertheless changes that everyone will have to adapt to and introduce an element of uncertainty."
The judge then set out (paras 56-62) her analysis of the "pros and cons of an adoptive placement." She began with this (paras 56-57):
 
"56	One advantage of adoption is that [B] will be brought up with her nearest relative, a full sibling. This would mean that she would never be alone, she would have the shared experiences of being brought up in the same household, which will promote identity and self-esteem. The research which I have been referred to suggests that the sibling relationship is emotionally powerful and critically important, not only in childhood but over the course of a lifetime. People spend more time with their siblings than anyone else. Growing up with a sibling enables one to learn social skills, sharing and managing conflict and negotiating. The relationship can provide a significant source of continuity throughout a child's lifetime and is likely to be the longest relationship most people experience.  
57		For children going into care it is generally accepted that siblings should be placed together unless it is contrary to an individual child's welfare needs. A shared history and experiences help self-identity and self-esteem because siblings provide support and companionship. An adoptive placement with her brother would mitigate against the loss of the relationship with her parents. This would be a lifelong relationship with her brother which would be promoted. The impact of becoming an adopted person, with the severance of legal and emotional ties with her parents and family, would also be mitigated by the shared experience of being with her brother."
As against that (para 61):
 
"The disadvantages of an adoption placement include severance of the links with the biological family. This can mean a real sense of loss, particularly to children when they get older and realise that they have not brought up within their biological family. It can also have a negative impact on their sense of identity and belonging. It will result in a loss of [B]'s relationship with her parents because there would be no direct contact with them. There would be a probable loss of contact with the extended family because it is unlikely that [B] will have contact with her half-siblings or with [I] and [R] and their family."
The judge concluded with a section (paras 63-69) headed "Decision." She began (paras 63-64):
 
"63	In the final analysis the court must decide whether the advantages associated with the sibling relationship outweigh the relationship with other family members: the parents, half-siblings, [I] and the wider family. This is the balancing exercise between the factors set out in Sections 1(4)(c) and (f) of the 2002 Act. I have already set out the benefits of the sibling relationship. Although there is no existing relationship between the siblings once the children are living in the same household one is likely to develop rapidly, given their closeness in age. I acknowledge the argument that to prioritise the relationship with a brother will be at the expense of all other family relationships. They do not have an existing relationship which can currently be given weight to, but rather the potential for a unique relationship lasting throughout their lives which the Guardian and social worker say should be prioritised.  
64		The reality and quality of a continuing relationship with other family members is very relevant here therefore. As I have identified already, the relationship with her parents is likely to be very limited. [Her father] is likely to be in [Africa], so contact will be indirect with possible occasional visits to [Africa]  Contact with the mother is likely to be either non-existent or problematic and potentially disruptive and unsettling. [B] has no existing relationship with her half-siblings, but only the potential for one. That is likely to be very limited. Those children are all quite a bit older than her and may or may not develop a bond."
She continued (paras 66-67):
 
"66	When considering [B]'s welfare throughout her life the scales tip in favour of prioritising the relationship with her brother for all the positive advantages that will bring her set out above. What makes this case particularly difficult and finely balanced is the cultural dimension. However, a close examination of what benefits [B] would actually derive from a placement with [I] and [R] reveals that [and she then set out various matters which I do not propose to repeat as they might lead to the identification of the family. She went on:] The practicalities and financial cost of frequent visits to [Africa] may prove problematic.  
67		Whilst a placement with [H] does not provide the cultural match which a placement with [I] could offer, the adopters have some cultural similarities and living with her brother would boost her identity because of growing up with her closest relative. His heritage and identity and early childhood experience of a foster placement at birth and then one stable placement afterwards, exactly mirrors her own. All this has led me to conclude that this is the over-riding requirement pertaining to [B]'s best interests throughout her life. Having reached that conclusion, I am satisfied that an adoption order is necessary to meet [B]'s needs and proportionate in all the circumstances of the case."
The judge concluded as follows (paras 68-69):
 
"68	Whilst this is more interventionist than a placement with [I] and [R], it has the benefit of permanency now. There will be no further delay. It will avoid the testing out of a placement with [I] and [R] and reduce the risks and uncertainties for [B] all of which adds weight to the decision that I have come to.  
69		So the order that I make is for a Care and Placement order and the parents' consent be dispensed with on the grounds that her welfare requires it."
I have deliberately set out the key passages in the judgment at some length for two reasons. First, because they bring out very clearly the judge's careful, thoughtful and nuanced approach. Secondly, because, at the end of the day, I am satisfied that her findings, her reasoning and her conclusions were plainly open to her on the totality of the evidence and other materials before her. They are, in my judgment, unassailable.
 
The father's grounds of appeal are, in essence, two-fold:
 
i)	The first complaint (ground 1) is that the judge erred in allowing her decision to become a competition between the adopters and the kinship carers. She was thus, it is said, drawn into assessing competing options without essential information about one of the options, with the consequence that her assessment was unfair and her order disproportionate.
ii)	The second complaint relates to the judge's evaluation of the two options, each of which was realistic. It is said (ground 2) that the judge erred in prioritising B's relationship with H over her relationships with her wider family and in placing too much emphasis on the sibling relationship; that (ground 3) she placed too much weight on the 'untested' nature of the placement with I and R while failing to acknowledge that the placement with H's adopters was equally untested; and that (ground 4) she was too focused on avoiding the potential delay and failed to balance the purpose of such delay to B's best interests.
In my judgment, none of these matters is made out and the appeal should accordingly be dismissed.
 
The central core of the father's complaint relates to the judge's application  in his counsel's submissions, her misapplication  of the principles in Re T, the essence of the complaint being that the judge had, in conflict with those principles, treated the matter as a competition between the adopters and the kinship carers and, illegitimately, been drawn into an inquiry as to which would be the 'better' placement. As the passages from her judgment (judgment, paras 20, 21 and 25) which I have set out demonstrate, that is not what the judge said she was doing or what she thought she was doing. Nor, in my judgment, is that what she was in fact doing. On the contrary, she was carefully, conscientiously and, in my judgment, correctly applying the learning in Re T.
 
How else was the judge to proceed? She was confronted with the fact  the reality  that B's only full sibling, H, a sibling close to her in age, had been adopted and that H's adoptive parents were willing to adopt B. That was not something the judge could ignore, as it were put out of her mind, if she was to comply with her statutory duty under section 1(4) and in particular section 1(4)(f) of the 2002 Act. And in having regard to that objective, factual, reality, the judge was doing nothing inconsistent with the learning in Re T and the earlier authorities to which I have referred. 
 
As Mr Tyler and Ms James pointedly observe, there is nothing in Re T to say that the court can ignore a crucial factor which is necessarily concomitant with a particular placement. The presence of H in B's life must fall in the credit side of the balance sheet in relation to placement with H's adopters, just as the loss of H must fall in the debit side in relation to the kinship placement; to ignore this would, they say, be a nonsense. I agree.   
 
Complaint is also made, in particular by Ms Fottrell and Ms MacLynn, that the judge never grappled with the question of whether adoption per se was required for B and, in consequence, that she truncated the adoption process and, in effect, approached the case as if she was deciding an adoption application and on the assumption that, immediately following the making of the placement order, B would be placed for adoption by H's adoptive parents. I do not agree. The judge was well aware that she was considering only the making (if appropriate) of care and placement orders as a prelude to the entirely separate adoption proceedings which, if she made those orders, would no doubt follow in due course. And, in circumstances where the fact and reality was that H had been adopted by those who were offering a similar placement for B, the distinction between adoption per se and adoption by H's adoptive parents is more apparent than real. 
 
The father complains that the process adopted by the judge meant that she ended up weighing the 'known' uncertainties in respect of the proposed kinship carers against the certainties of the adoptive placement. That, it is said, was an unfair half-way house; the judge, on this approach, should have embarked upon a full welfare evaluation and comparison of each prospective placement. I do not agree. The judge knew all that she needed to know about the possible placement with H's adoptive parents to be able properly to carry out, and in a manner compatible with Re T, the task she was embarked upon. Indeed, to go further into that aspect of the matter than she did would have risked offending against the principle in Re T. 
 
In relation to the other grounds of appeal I can be quite brief. The father complains that the judge erred in prioritising B's relationship with H over her relationships with her wider family, in placing too much emphasis on the sibling relationship, and in attaching too little weight to 'nothing else will do'. I do not agree. The judge did not prioritise either of these placements  both, it is to be noted, family placements  over the other. She treated each as being viable and realistic and carefully evaluated the competing evidence and arguments before coming to her conclusion. The fact that her conclusion favoured X rather than Y does not mean that the judge was prioritising X over Y. Her conclusion that, in all the circumstances, B's future relationship with H throughout their lives tipped the balance and was determinative of the outcome, was, in my judgment, securely founded in the evidence the judge had heard and, as I have already said, was plainly open to her.    
 
I can take the two remaining grounds  that the judge placed too much weight on the 'untested' nature of the placement with I and R while failing to acknowledge that the placement with H's adopters was equally untested; and that she was too focused on avoiding the potential delay and failed to balance the purpose of such delay to B's best interests  together. The judge, in my judgment, was entitled to have regard to these factors, and it was for her to determine how much weight to attach to them. In fact, as we have seen, she did not attribute determinative weight to other of them. As her judgment makes clear (judgment, para 68) their impact was merely to "add  weight to the decision that I have come to."
 
Lord Justice Davis :
I agree.

[
LADY JUSTICE THIRLWALL : 

	This appeal arises in a claim for damages for personal injury sustained in the workplace.   The appellants are three defendants who employed the claimant at different periods during the years 1985 to the date of the trial.   I shall refer to the respondent as the claimant and to the appellants as the defendants.  

 
	It was the claimant's case that each defendant was in breach of its duty to take reasonable care to protect him from sustaining injury during the course of his employment.    He alleged that frequent and prolonged use of vibrating tools caused him to suffer from vibration white finger (VWF) and carpal tunnel syndrome.    The defendants admitted each owed a duty of care to the claimant as claimed.  It was agreed at trial that none of the defendants took any steps at any time to warn, advise or monitor the claimant in respect of the potential effects on his health of working with vibrating tools.  Each defendant denied that the claimant was subject to frequent or prolonged exposure to vibrating tools as alleged.  Breach of duty was denied.  Causation was also in issue. The first and third defendants pleaded a limitation defence.

 
	A trial was directed of two issues: limitation and breach of duty.  The trial took place over 4 days some months apart - 15 and 16 October 2014 and 16 and 17 February 2015.  The recorder gave an extempore judgment on 18 February 2015.  He dismissed the limitation defence on the grounds that the claimant's date of knowledge (as defined in Section 14 Limitation Act 1980) was within the three years before the issue of proceedings.   There is no appeal against that determination.   

 
	The recorder also concluded that each defendant was in breach of its duty of care to the claimant because over many years it "transitorily" exposed the claimant to vibration speeds above what is known in the industry as "the threshold level" but took no steps to warn him about the potential effects on health of working with vibrating tools, or to monitor his exposure or otherwise to advise him about working with vibrating tools.   It is against the finding of breach that the defendants appeal.     Background

 
	It was the claimant's case that he began working with vibrating tools from about 1986.  The British Standard relevant to the facts in this case is the Guide to Measurement and evaluation of human exposure to vibration transmitted to the hand, BS 6842; 1987.  It provides guidance to those who manufacture vibrating tools as to how vibration likely to cause injury should be measured.  The assessment of vibration exposure is primarily based on the measurement of daily exposure.  To facilitate comparisons between different durations of exposure to different tools with different vibration speeds, the daily exposure is expressed in terms of the 8 hour energy equivalent frequency weighted acceleration: A8.  This is set out at Table 5 of the document which for ease of reference I have set out below.  It shows that where 100 people are exposed daily to vibrations of an acceleration magnitude of 2.8m/s2, 10 of them are likely to suffer symptoms within 8 years.  Where the acceleration magnitude is half that ie 1.4m/s2 the period of exposure after which 10% are likely to have symptoms is 16 years.  The effect is linear and cumulative thus where the daily exposure (A8) is 15 minutes then the level of acceleration magnitude which would be likely to produce symptoms in 10% of those using the tools after 8 years is 16m/s2.  After 16 years the figure is 8.0m/s2.  Three notes precede the table.  These are:-Note 1 : The values presented in table 5 are based on exposures which are regularly repeated on a daily basisNote 2 : If, for a specific daily exposure duration and life-time exposure, the acceleration is in excess of that required to produce 10% prevalence, a higher incidence of symptoms may be expected.  There will be a complex relationship between vibration exposure and prevalence of symptoms.  When the vibration exposure is high (eg after many years of exposure) the prevalence may be particularly dependent on the rate at which persons join and leave the vibration exposed group.  While there have been useful attempts to relate prevalence to vibration exposure these findings are currently restricted by the shortage of available data.Note 3: A prevalence of 10% has been chosen as a convenient example.  The scientific literature can be consulted to discover some exposures which have given rise to other prevalence rates.

	Two of the three notes which follow the table are relevant here:i) with short duration exposure the magnitudes are high and vascular disorders may not be the first adverse symptoms to develop.ii) iii) Within the 10% of exposed persons who develop finger blanching, there may be a variation in severity of symptoms.

 
	Each item of vibratory equipment has a recognised vibration level.  What it is depends on the age and condition of the equipment, the material against which it is vibrating and so forth.  New equipment is designed to have a lower level of vibration.  Manufacturers should be guided by table 5 when designing machines.  That is not to say that a level of A8 2.8m/s2 is a safe level of vibration given that it leads to injury in 10% of workers. 

 
	At paragraph 2.1 of the guide under the heading "General considerations" there is a list of factors which were and are believed to influence the severity of the effects of hand-transmitted vibration.  In addition to the frequency spectrum of vibration are included the length and frequency of work and rest spells, whether the tool is laid aside or held idling during breaks in work etc,  the duration of exposure per working day, the cumulative exposure to date.

 
	There was also before the court the publication HS(G) 88, Hand-Arm Vibration, produced by the Health and Safety Executive in 1994.  It was part of a series of documents with the purpose of providing guidance for those who have duties under the Health and Safety at Work etc Act 1974.  From the opening chapter under key points and throughout, it is made plain that employers must be aware of and guard against the risk of injury where people regularly work with vibrating tools for prolonged periods.   This is explicit at paragraph 21 of the document where the following appears "Programmes of preventive measures and health surveillance are recommended where workers' exposure regularly exceeds an A(8) of 2.8m/s2." 

 
	The recorder set out at paragraphs 13 and 14 of the judgment the agreed position as to the risk of injury caused by vibration.  He observed that throughout the period that the claimant was employed by the three defendants it was agreed that there was a foreseeable risk of injury to a person exposed to levels of vibration of 1m/s2 [A8].   This is generally described as the threshold level.  Below that level there was no foreseeable risk of injury resulting from exposure to vibrating tools and employers owed no duty of care at common law.  Above that level there was a duty upon an employer at common law and, later, pursuant to the Control of Vibration at Work Regulations 2005, to take some steps to alert employees to the potential risk of injury by warning, monitoring and advising those using vibrating tools.  Above the action level ie 2.8m/s2, active steps such as reduction of exposure by modification of tools, job rotation and the like was required.  What was omitted from the agreement, but should be taken as read for it accurately to reflect reality, was that isolated exposure to levels above the threshold or action level does not lead to a foreseeable risk of injury.   What is required is regular (or, more accurately, frequent) exposure to those levels.

 
	In a decision of this court in Armstrong v British Coal Corporation No 2, 31 July 1998 unreported, it was held that there was a duty to warn employees in the coalmining industry about the risk of developing VWF from vibratory tools.  Judge LJ as he then was, suggested the following would be suitable, "If you are working with vibrating tools and you notice that you are getting some whitening or discolouration of any of your fingers, then in your own interests you should report this as quickly as possible.  If you do nothing, you could end up with some very nasty problems in both hands."  That suggested form of words echoes the advice in BS 6842; 1987 at B3 of Appendix  B which is headed "Guidelines on preventive procedures."  "(a) All individuals who use vibrating equipment should be advised of the risk of exposure to hand arm vibration."  At B4 under the heading "Advice to individuals who use vibrating tools" was this (d) Should attacks of white or blue finger or long periods of tingling and/or numbness occur, seek medical advice."The guidance does not say in terms that the advice should be given when individuals use vibrating equipment on a regular or frequent basis but that is implicit from the context.  In Doherty and others v Rugby Joinery (UK) Ltd [2004] EWCA Civ 147 Hale LJ as she then was reviewed BS 6842: 1987 and the much earlier BS DD43: 1975.  It is not necessary to set out the latter.  At paragraph 52 of her judgment Hale LJ said "It is clear from both documents that the state of knowledge was not sufficient to lay down a safe standard of exposure.  The variables were too complex, and included individual susceptibility.  Thus it could be suggested that any employer whose employees regularly used hand-held vibratory tools should at the very least take steps to warn them of the possible dangers and advise them to report any symptoms when they occurred."Expert Evidence

 
	 The experts' evidence was agreed and so they were not called.  They agreed that if the claimant's account of his usage of vibrating tools was accepted then it was very likely that he had been exposed to "a hand/arm vibration dose exceeding the action level on a regular basis dependent upon the actual duration of his average working day".  They also agreed that if the defendants' account (as set out in their employees' witness statements) of his usage of vibrating tools was accepted "then it is highly likely that the claimant was not exposed to significant hand/arm vibration."  Mr Taylor was asked to define "significant" in this context.  It meant exposure to a hand/arm vibration dose exceeding the threshold level. 

 
	Some of the defendants' witnesses' statements conceded that the claimant used vibrating tools, including needle guns (as to which see below) but only occasionally.  Unsurprisingly the experts did not suggest that this occasional use meant that the claimant had been exposed to significant hand/arm vibration.     

 
 The recorder's findingsThe recorder found that the claimant had worked for the first defendant between 1985 and 1990/91, in 2003 for six weeks and again from 2009 up to the date of trial.  He did not work with vibrating tools until 1986.  He had worked for the second defendant between 1995 and 2003, the third defendant between 1991 and 1994.  Between 2003 and 2009 he worked again for the second defendant during which time he spent two years performing clerical duties and only some maintenance work.  It was the claimant's pleaded case which he maintained in evidence that each of his employers had exposed him to excessive levels of vibration on a continuous basis for 7080% of his working life.   The recorder rejected that case in robust terms.  He was satisfied that the claimant was deliberately exaggerating the extent of his exposure.   No criticism is made of that finding, which was plainly correct. The recorder found that the claimant was an armature winder.  Armature winding is a highly skilled job which does not involve the use of vibrating machine tools.  He found that the claimant also carried out other tasks more usually carried out by fitters but he did so much less frequently than armature winding.  The other tasks did require the use of vibrating tools, including needle guns and air chisels, both of which reached the threshold level in a relatively short period of time of use (3 minutes according to the table produced by Mr Taylor at page 494):

	The recorder referred to the evidence of Mr Hannigan, employed by the first defendant who confirmed that a needle gun was used by the claimant, albeit on an irregular basis, for removing heavy corrosion from motors, for periods of ten minutes at a time, then a break would be taken and the work would continue.  The recorder observed (paragraph 23) that "Mr Woolwich [who gave evidence for the second defendant] conceded tool usage at a level which led Mr Worthington (the defendant's expert) to suggest that if all the tools mentioned were used equally for the period of time mentioned then the threshold level would be exceeded but not the action level".   The recorder made no finding about that.

 
	At paragraph 29 the recorder found (and clarified the finding at 31) that the claimant used needle guns throughout his employment by each defendant and, until 1999, air chisels (except when employed by the second defendant which did not use air chisels.).  It is plain from the context that the recorder considered the use of needle guns (throughout) and air chisels (up to 1999) occasional but it took place over many years.  He concluded at paragraph 30 that "to the extent the claimant used the needle gun and the air chisel with all the defendants there was a breach of duty "in that he was transitorilyexposed to levels above the threshold."  He concluded, "I appreciate that this is probably not helpful to either party  and we have already discussed the constraints within which I have to deal with these matters caused by the splitting of the trial into two parts and the absence of the experts  but there it is.  Therefore, to that limited extent, there was a breach of duty in relation to the exposure and there was, therefore, accordingly, a breach of duty in relation to the requirements either at common law or later pursuant to statute following such a breach of the threshold limit".  I am quite satisfied that in saying "there was a breach of duty in relation to the exposure" the recorder meant that from time to time the exposure exceeded or breached the threshold level and accordingly, given the absence of any warnings or other advice or monitoring, breach of duty followed. 

 

	The recorder did not determine what the consequences would have been had the claimant received an appropriate warning or advice or there had been some monitoring.  This was because of earlier case management directions which the parties did not invite him to review.   Whilst I understand the reasons for leaving the question of causation of injury to a separate hearing, it is not clear to me why the question of what would have happened had the warning, advice or monitoring been undertaken, could not have been answered at this hearing.   Be that as it may the recorder characterised his finding of breach as limited. Its effect was likely to be very limited;  given that the claimant was still working at the time of the trial, knowing of his condition, knowing the medical advice and knowing of the basis of his claim.  Since the recorder made no findings I say no more about it.    

 
The Grounds of Appeal
	Miss Foster developed a number of grounds before us.  First she submitted, as she had before the recorder, that this was an all or nothing case.   The claimant having failed to prove his case could not succeed on a version of the facts different from his case and that of the defendant.    There was evidence before the recorder, called by the defendants, upon which he was entitled to rely, that the claimant had indeed used vibrating tools, albeit very much less frequently than he had asserted, see above.  It is not unusual for a judge to make findings of fact that reflect the case of neither the claimant nor the defendant.  The question is, was the evidence available to justify his findings?   The answer to that is plainly yes.  Indeed permission to appeal was sought (and granted) on the specific basis that there was no challenge to any of the recorder's findings of fact. 

 

	The question of law, as the single judge identified, is whether, having found that the claimant was transitorily exposed to levels above the threshold, the recorder was entitled to conclude that this (combined with the admitted failure to warn etc) meant that each of the defendants was in breach of duty.   Ms Foster submits that "transitory" (and I would add for the purposes of the argument, occasional) exposure to levels above the threshold does not automatically lead to a finding of breach of duty.  I agree.   

 

	During the course of closing submissions Mr Woolfenden had submitted that the recorder could make findings of fact which reflected neither the claimant's nor the defendants' case and conclude that the exposure, while not at the action level, was above the threshold level and so, in the admitted absence of any warning etc, tortious.   The recorder expressed the view that this would require him to constitute himself an expert and apply expertise to a different set of facts from the two put before the engineers and upon which they had come to their agreed position.   Miss Foster argued against Mr Woolfenden's proposal.   In the course of his judgment the recorder made clear that he had decided that the existing expert opinion was sufficient for him to conclude that the threshold level had been breached on occasion and so there had been a breach of duty.  He explained his approach thus "I feel able to depart, however, from my initial comments to Mr Woolfenden about not being able to constitute myself an expert because, in relation to chisels and needle guns, there is a simple table [drafted by Mr Taylor  see paragraph 10 above] to which I can apply the evidence of Mr Hannigan.  I accept that that is in relation to needle guns.  In relation to air chisels, it seems that in the early years of the claimant's career he would have to chisel the heads off the cores on the motor before he could begin his work."  

 
	Ms Foster submits that the recorder misunderstood the basis upon which Mr Taylor's table was compiled ie that the assessment of vibration exposure is primarily based on the measurement of daily exposure.  There is nothing in the judgment to suggest that the recorder did not understand the basis of the assessment of exposure and he was not wrong to conclude that if a needle gun was being used, the threshold level was reached after 3 minutes.   However whether there was a breach of duty depended on the frequency of the use of the needle gun and/or the air chisel and he made no findings about that.  He did find that the tools were used over many years.    

 
	Mr Woolfenden's submission, repeated before us by Mr Benson QC, was that 30 minutes exposure to a needle gun once a fortnight equates to 3 minutes per working day.   Mr Woolfenden urged the recorder to make a finding that the needle gun was used once a fortnight, at least with the first defendant.   To that should be added, Mr Benson reminded us, the exposure to the air chisel at or above the threshold level and the fact that the claimant was exposed to these tools over many years.  

 
	There are two problems with the approach in respect of the fortnightly use of the needle gun: first there is no expert evidence to suggest that a single occasion of 30 minutes exposure equates to 3 minutes on 10 occasions.   Second, and more importantly, the recorder made no finding that the claimant used the needle gun once a fortnight or at any other level of frequency or regularity nor did he make any findings about the frequency of use of the air chisel.  Having re-read the whole of the lay evidence I am not surprised by this.   At its highest the recorder found "transitory" exposure above the threshold.   In the absence of any finding as to frequency and any expert evidence about the effect of intermittent use at such a frequency it was not open to the recorder to move from a finding of transitory exposure even over many years to a conclusion that this constituted a breach of duty by the defendants.   To come to that conclusion he would have had first to find that the claimant was using the needle gun and/or the air chisel at or above the threshold level on a regular/frequent basis and it was in that situation that there had been no warning, advice, monitoring etc.  He did not do so because he was rightly not satisfied on the evidence that the use of vibrating tools was either regular or frequent.   The evidence was all the other way.   

 
	It follows that the recorder's conclusion as to breach of duty cannot stand.   I would allow this appeal.   Lord Justice Moylan

LADY JUSTICE THIRLWALL : 

	This appeal arises in a claim for damages for personal injury sustained in the workplace.   The appellants are three defendants who employed the claimant at different periods during the years 1985 to the date of the trial.   I shall refer to the respondent as the claimant and to the appellants as the defendants.  

 
	It was the claimant's case that each defendant was in breach of its duty to take reasonable care to protect him from sustaining injury during the course of his employment.    He alleged that frequent and prolonged use of vibrating tools caused him to suffer from vibration white finger (VWF) and carpal tunnel syndrome.    The defendants admitted each owed a duty of care to the claimant as claimed.  It was agreed at trial that none of the defendants took any steps at any time to warn, advise or monitor the claimant in respect of the potential effects on his health of working with vibrating tools.  Each defendant denied that the claimant was subject to frequent or prolonged exposure to vibrating tools as alleged.  Breach of duty was denied.  Causation was also in issue. The first and third defendants pleaded a limitation defence.

 
	A trial was directed of two issues: limitation and breach of duty.  The trial took place over 4 days some months apart - 15 and 16 October 2014 and 16 and 17 February 2015.  The recorder gave an extempore judgment on 18 February 2015.  He dismissed the limitation defence on the grounds that the claimant's date of knowledge (as defined in Section 14 Limitation Act 1980) was within the three years before the issue of proceedings.   There is no appeal against that determination.   

 
	The recorder also concluded that each defendant was in breach of its duty of care to the claimant because over many years it "transitorily" exposed the claimant to vibration speeds above what is known in the industry as "the threshold level" but took no steps to warn him about the potential effects on health of working with vibrating tools, or to monitor his exposure or otherwise to advise him about working with vibrating tools.   It is against the finding of breach that the defendants appeal.     Background

 
	It was the claimant's case that he began working with vibrating tools from about 1986.  The British Standard relevant to the facts in this case is the Guide to Measurement and evaluation of human exposure to vibration transmitted to the hand, BS 6842; 1987.  It provides guidance to those who manufacture vibrating tools as to how vibration likely to cause injury should be measured.  The assessment of vibration exposure is primarily based on the measurement of daily exposure.  To facilitate comparisons between different durations of exposure to different tools with different vibration speeds, the daily exposure is expressed in terms of the 8 hour energy equivalent frequency weighted acceleration: A8.  This is set out at Table 5 of the document which for ease of reference I have set out below.  It shows that where 100 people are exposed daily to vibrations of an acceleration magnitude of 2.8m/s2, 10 of them are likely to suffer symptoms within 8 years.  Where the acceleration magnitude is half that ie 1.4m/s2 the period of exposure after which 10% are likely to have symptoms is 16 years.  The effect is linear and cumulative thus where the daily exposure (A8) is 15 minutes then the level of acceleration magnitude which would be likely to produce symptoms in 10% of those using the tools after 8 years is 16m/s2.  After 16 years the figure is 8.0m/s2.  Three notes precede the table.  These are:-Note 1 : The values presented in table 5 are based on exposures which are regularly repeated on a daily basisNote 2 : If, for a specific daily exposure duration and life-time exposure, the acceleration is in excess of that required to produce 10% prevalence, a higher incidence of symptoms may be expected.  There will be a complex relationship between vibration exposure and prevalence of symptoms.  When the vibration exposure is high (eg after many years of exposure) the prevalence may be particularly dependent on the rate at which persons join and leave the vibration exposed group.  While there have been useful attempts to relate prevalence to vibration exposure these findings are currently restricted by the shortage of available data.Note 3: A prevalence of 10% has been chosen as a convenient example.  The scientific literature can be consulted to discover some exposures which have given rise to other prevalence rates.

	Two of the three notes which follow the table are relevant here:i) with short duration exposure the magnitudes are high and vascular disorders may not be the first adverse symptoms to develop.ii) iii) Within the 10% of exposed persons who develop finger blanching, there may be a variation in severity of symptoms.

 
	Each item of vibratory equipment has a recognised vibration level.  What it is depends on the age and condition of the equipment, the material against which it is vibrating and so forth.  New equipment is designed to have a lower level of vibration.  Manufacturers should be guided by table 5 when designing machines.  That is not to say that a level of A8 2.8m/s2 is a safe level of vibration given that it leads to injury in 10% of workers. 

 
	At paragraph 2.1 of the guide under the heading "General considerations" there is a list of factors which were and are believed to influence the severity of the effects of hand-transmitted vibration.  In addition to the frequency spectrum of vibration are included the length and frequency of work and rest spells, whether the tool is laid aside or held idling during breaks in work etc,  the duration of exposure per working day, the cumulative exposure to date.

 
	There was also before the court the publication HS(G) 88, Hand-Arm Vibration, produced by the Health and Safety Executive in 1994.  It was part of a series of documents with the purpose of providing guidance for those who have duties under the Health and Safety at Work etc Act 1974.  From the opening chapter under key points and throughout, it is made plain that employers must be aware of and guard against the risk of injury where people regularly work with vibrating tools for prolonged periods.   This is explicit at paragraph 21 of the document where the following appears "Programmes of preventive measures and health surveillance are recommended where workers' exposure regularly exceeds an A(8) of 2.8m/s2." 

 
	The recorder set out at paragraphs 13 and 14 of the judgment the agreed position as to the risk of injury caused by vibration.  He observed that throughout the period that the claimant was employed by the three defendants it was agreed that there was a foreseeable risk of injury to a person exposed to levels of vibration of 1m/s2 [A8].   This is generally described as the threshold level.  Below that level there was no foreseeable risk of injury resulting from exposure to vibrating tools and employers owed no duty of care at common law.  Above that level there was a duty upon an employer at common law and, later, pursuant to the Control of Vibration at Work Regulations 2005, to take some steps to alert employees to the potential risk of injury by warning, monitoring and advising those using vibrating tools.  Above the action level ie 2.8m/s2, active steps such as reduction of exposure by modification of tools, job rotation and the like was required.  What was omitted from the agreement, but should be taken as read for it accurately to reflect reality, was that isolated exposure to levels above the threshold or action level does not lead to a foreseeable risk of injury.   What is required is regular (or, more accurately, frequent) exposure to those levels.

 
	In a decision of this court in Armstrong v British Coal Corporation No 2, 31 July 1998 unreported, it was held that there was a duty to warn employees in the coalmining industry about the risk of developing VWF from vibratory tools.  Judge LJ as he then was, suggested the following would be suitable, "If you are working with vibrating tools and you notice that you are getting some whitening or discolouration of any of your fingers, then in your own interests you should report this as quickly as possible.  If you do nothing, you could end up with some very nasty problems in both hands."  That suggested form of words echoes the advice in BS 6842; 1987 at B3 of Appendix  B which is headed "Guidelines on preventive procedures."  "(a) All individuals who use vibrating equipment should be advised of the risk of exposure to hand arm vibration."  At B4 under the heading "Advice to individuals who use vibrating tools" was this (d) Should attacks of white or blue finger or long periods of tingling and/or numbness occur, seek medical advice."The guidance does not say in terms that the advice should be given when individuals use vibrating equipment on a regular or frequent basis but that is implicit from the context.  In Doherty and others v Rugby Joinery (UK) Ltd [2004] EWCA Civ 147 Hale LJ as she then was reviewed BS 6842: 1987 and the much earlier BS DD43: 1975.  It is not necessary to set out the latter.  At paragraph 52 of her judgment Hale LJ said "It is clear from both documents that the state of knowledge was not sufficient to lay down a safe standard of exposure.  The variables were too complex, and included individual susceptibility.  Thus it could be suggested that any employer whose employees regularly used hand-held vibratory tools should at the very least take steps to warn them of the possible dangers and advise them to report any symptoms when they occurred."Expert Evidence

 
	 The experts' evidence was agreed and so they were not called.  They agreed that if the claimant's account of his usage of vibrating tools was accepted then it was very likely that he had been exposed to "a hand/arm vibration dose exceeding the action level on a regular basis dependent upon the actual duration of his average working day".  They also agreed that if the defendants' account (as set out in their employees' witness statements) of his usage of vibrating tools was accepted "then it is highly likely that the claimant was not exposed to significant hand/arm vibration."  Mr Taylor was asked to define "significant" in this context.  It meant exposure to a hand/arm vibration dose exceeding the threshold level. 

 
	Some of the defendants' witnesses' statements conceded that the claimant used vibrating tools, including needle guns (as to which see below) but only occasionally.  Unsurprisingly the experts did not suggest that this occasional use meant that the claimant had been exposed to significant hand/arm vibration.     

 
 The recorder's findingsThe recorder found that the claimant had worked for the first defendant between 1985 and 1990/91, in 2003 for six weeks and again from 2009 up to the date of trial.  He did not work with vibrating tools until 1986.  He had worked for the second defendant between 1995 and 2003, the third defendant between 1991 and 1994.  Between 2003 and 2009 he worked again for the second defendant during which time he spent two years performing clerical duties and only some maintenance work.  It was the claimant's pleaded case which he maintained in evidence that each of his employers had exposed him to excessive levels of vibration on a continuous basis for 7080% of his working life.   The recorder rejected that case in robust terms.  He was satisfied that the claimant was deliberately exaggerating the extent of his exposure.   No criticism is made of that finding, which was plainly correct. The recorder found that the claimant was an armature winder.  Armature winding is a highly skilled job which does not involve the use of vibrating machine tools.  He found that the claimant also carried out other tasks more usually carried out by fitters but he did so much less frequently than armature winding.  The other tasks did require the use of vibrating tools, including needle guns and air chisels, both of which reached the threshold level in a relatively short period of time of use (3 minutes according to the table produced by Mr Taylor at page 494):

It is plain from the context that the recorder considered the use of needle guns (throughout) and air chisels (up to 1999) occasional but it took place over many years.

	The recorder did not determine what the consequences would have been had the claimant received an appropriate warning or advice or there had been some monitoring.

Since the recorder made no findings I say no more about it.    

 
The Grounds of Appeal
	Miss Foster developed a number of grounds before us.  First she submitted, as she had before the recorder, that this was an all or nothing case.   The claimant having failed to prove his case could not succeed on a version of the facts different from his case and that of the defendant.    There was evidence before the recorder, called by the defendants, upon which he was entitled to rely, that the claimant had indeed used vibrating tools, albeit very much less frequently than he had asserted, see above.  It is not unusual for a judge to make findings of fact that reflect the case of neither the claimant nor the defendant.  The question is, was the evidence available to justify his findings?   The answer to that is plainly yes.  Indeed permission to appeal was sought (and granted) on the specific basis that there was no challenge to any of the recorder's findings of fact. 

 

	The question of law, as the single judge identified, is whether, having found that the claimant was transitorily exposed to levels above the threshold, the recorder was entitled to conclude that this (combined with the admitted failure to warn etc) meant that each of the defendants was in breach of duty.   Ms Foster submits that "transitory" (and I would add for the purposes of the argument, occasional) exposure to levels above the threshold does not automatically lead to a finding of breach of duty.  I agree.   

 

	During the course of closing submissions Mr Woolfenden had submitted that the recorder could make findings of fact which reflected neither the claimant's nor the defendants' case and conclude that the exposure, while not at the action level, was above the threshold level and so, in the admitted absence of any warning etc, tortious.   The recorder expressed the view that this would require him to constitute himself an expert and apply expertise to a different set of facts from the two put before the engineers and upon which they had come to their agreed position.   Miss Foster argued against Mr Woolfenden's proposal.   In the course of his judgment the recorder made clear that he had decided that the existing expert opinion was sufficient for him to conclude that the threshold level had been breached on occasion and so there had been a breach of duty.  He explained his approach thus "I feel able to depart, however, from my initial comments to Mr Woolfenden about not being able to constitute myself an expert because, in relation to chisels and needle guns, there is a simple table [drafted by Mr Taylor  see paragraph 10 above] to which I can apply the evidence of Mr Hannigan.  I accept that that is in relation to needle guns.  In relation to air chisels, it seems that in the early years of the claimant's career he would have to chisel the heads off the cores on the motor before he could begin his work."  

 
	Ms Foster submits that the recorder misunderstood the basis upon which Mr Taylor's table was compiled ie that the assessment of vibration exposure is primarily based on the measurement of daily exposure.  There is nothing in the judgment to suggest that the recorder did not understand the basis of the assessment of exposure and he was not wrong to conclude that if a needle gun was being used, the threshold level was reached after 3 minutes.   However whether there was a breach of duty depended on the frequency of the use of the needle gun and/or the air chisel and he made no findings about that.  He did find that the tools were used over many years.    

 
	Mr Woolfenden's submission, repeated before us by Mr Benson QC, was that 30 minutes exposure to a needle gun once a fortnight equates to 3 minutes per working day.   Mr Woolfenden urged the recorder to make a finding that the needle gun was used once a fortnight, at least with the first defendant.   To that should be added, Mr Benson reminded us, the exposure to the air chisel at or above the threshold level and the fact that the claimant was exposed to these tools over many years.  

 
	There are two problems with the approach in respect of the fortnightly use of the needle gun: first there is no expert evidence to suggest that a single occasion of 30 minutes exposure equates to 3 minutes on 10 occasions.   Second, and more importantly, the recorder made no finding that the claimant used the needle gun once a fortnight or at any other level of frequency or regularity nor did he make any findings about the frequency of use of the air chisel.  Having re-read the whole of the lay evidence I am not surprised by this.   At its highest the recorder found "transitory" exposure above the threshold.   In the absence of any finding as to frequency and any expert evidence about the effect of intermittent use at such a frequency it was not open to the recorder to move from a finding of transitory exposure even over many years to a conclusion that this constituted a breach of duty by the defendants.   To come to that conclusion he would have had first to find that the claimant was using the needle gun and/or the air chisel at or above the threshold level on a regular/frequent basis and it was in that situation that there had been no warning, advice, monitoring etc.  He did not do so because he was rightly not satisfied on the evidence that the use of vibrating tools was either regular or frequent.   The evidence was all the other way.   

 
	It follows that the recorder's conclusion as to breach of duty cannot stand.   I would allow this appeal.   Lord Justice Moylan

Lord Justice Newey: 
The issue raised by this appeal is whether a litigant in person in whose favour a costs order is made can recover for work undertaken by a foreign lawyer.

 
The appellant, Mr Richard Campbell, was represented in these proceedings by a London law firm, Cooke, Young & Keidan, until May 2016. He then became a litigant in person, but he has been assisted in matters relating to the litigation by Dickinson Gleeson, a firm of Jersey advocates that has been acting for him in a related case in Jersey. As regards the present proceedings, Dickinson Gleeson have, for example, helped the appellant with the drafting of correspondence and witness statements and by reviewing and advising on Scott schedules and disclosed documents. Most of the relevant work was undertaken by one partner in Dickinson Gleeson, Mr James Dickinson. Mr Dickinson qualified as a solicitor in this jurisdiction in 1997, but he moved to Jersey in 1999, became an Advocate of the Royal Court of Jersey in 2004 and, I gather, ceased to be on the roll of solicitors in England and Wales in 2014. I understand that he has now had his name restored to the roll and been granted a practising certificate, but he was not entitled to practise as a solicitor in England and Wales during the period relevant to this appeal.

 
The costs of litigants in person are addressed in CPR 46.5. So far as material, that provides:

 
"(1) This rule applies where the court orders (whether by summary assessment or detailed assessment) that the costs of a litigant in person are to be paid by any other person.
(2) The costs allowed under this rule will not exceed, except in the case of a disbursement, two-thirds of the amount which would have been allowed if the litigant in person had been represented by a legal representative.
(3) The litigant in person shall be allowed
(a) costs for the same categories of
(i) work; and
(ii) disbursements,
which would have been allowed if the work had been done or the disbursements had been made by a legal representative on the litigant in person's behalf;
(b) the payments reasonably made by the litigant in person for legal services relating to the conduct of the proceedings; and
(c) the costs of obtaining expert assistance in assessing the costs claim.
(4) The amount of costs to be allowed to the litigant in person for any item of work claimed will be
(a) where the litigant can prove financial loss, the amount that the litigant can prove to have been lost for time reasonably spent on doing the work; or
(b) where the litigant cannot prove financial loss, an amount for the time reasonably spent on doing the work at the rate set out in Practice Direction 46."
(Emphasis added.)
The term "legal representative", which features in CPR 46.5(2) and (3)(a), is defined in CPR 2.3(1) to mean a:

 
"(a) 	barrister;
(b) 	solicitor;
(c) 	solicitor's employee;
(d)	manager of a body recognised under section 9 of the Administration of Justice Act 1985; or
(e) 	person who, for the purposes of the Legal Services Act 2007, is an authorised person in relation to an activity which constitutes the conduct of litigation (within the meaning of that Act),
who has been instructed to act for a party in relation to proceedings".
The focus of the present appeal is on CPR 46.5(3)(b). It is the appellant's case that this extends to payments made for the services of a foreign lawyer. Mr David Foxton QC, sitting as a Deputy High Court Judge, decided otherwise, concluding (in paragraph 17 of his judgment) that "services provided by a lawyer qualified in another jurisdiction do not constitute 'legal services' for the purposes of CPR 46.5(3)(b)". The appellant, however, challenges that view before this Court.

 
We were referred to two decisions in which the interpretation of what used to be CPR 48.6(3) (which has now become CPR 46.5(3)) was considered. In the earlier of the cases, United Building and Plumbing Contractors v Kajla [2002] EWCA Civ 628, [2002] CP Rep 53, the successful claimant had been assisted by the director of a debt collection company, a Mr Whiteland. The Court of Appeal held that there had been no jurisdiction to order the defendant to pay any of Mr Whiteland's fees. In the course of his judgment, Tuckey LJ, with whom Rix LJ agreed, said this about what was then CPR 48.6(3)(b) (at paragraph 14):

 
"Sub-paragraph (b) relates to 'legal services', which are not defined by the rules. The notes in the White Book suggest that this sub-paragraph was intended to cover partial legal services; in other words some legal advice or assistance short of full representation. But I think the sub-paragraph is referring to services which are 'legal'; that is to say, services provided by or under the supervision of a lawyer. On the face of it, Mr Whiteland was not providing such services. Therefore the judge had no jurisdiction to award the respondent any part of Mr Whiteland's fees."
The other authority, Agassi v Robinson (Inspector of Taxes) (No 2) [2005] EWCA Civ 1507, [2006] 1 WLR 2126, concerned fees paid to Tenon Media, experts in tax law whom Mr André Agassi, the well-known tennis player, had used in place of a firm of solicitors. One of the issues before the Court of Appeal was whether the fees could be recovered as a "disbursement" within CPR 48.6(3)(a)(ii) (now CPR 46.5(3)(a)(ii)). The Court decided that they could not. Dyson LJ, with whom Brooke and Carnwath LJJ agreed, explained that a "clear distinction has always been recognised between disbursements made and work done by a legal representative" (see paragraph 74) and said (in paragraph 73):

 
"The rule contemplates allowing as costs only those categories of disbursements which would normally have been made by a legal representative. If the expenditure is for work which a legal representative would normally have done himself, it is not a disbursement within the language of CPR r 48.6(3)(a)(ii)."
It followed that Mr Agassi was "not entitled to recover costs as a disbursement in respect of work done by Tenon which would normally have been done by a solicitor who had been instructed to conduct the appeal" (paragraph 75). Further, the Court took the view that "none of the items [of work at issue] are legal services which fall within CPR r 48.6(3)(b)" (paragraph 79), the Court considering that the reasoning in the United Building and Plumbing Contractors case was both binding on it and correct (paragraph 72).
In a postscript, Dyson LJ observed that members of organisations such as the Chartered Institute of Taxation "have specialist expertise in the field of tax law, often far exceeding that of solicitors" (paragraph 80). He went on:

 
"81 At first sight, it might seem regrettable that Mr Agassi should not be entitled to recover all of Tenon's fees, provided that they are reasonable and proportionate. But so to hold would undermine the delicate balance struck by CPR r 48.6(3) and conflict with the established understanding of what is allowable as a disbursement. Furthermore,  if Mr Agassi is entitled to recover Tenon's reasonable and proportionate fees under CPR r 48.6, so too would a litigant in person be able to recover the reasonable and proportionate fees of any person who provides general assistance in litigation. In view of the restricted ambit of section 20(1) of the 1974 Act [i.e. the Solicitors Act 1974] and of the definition of the 'right to conduct litigation' in the 1990 Act [i.e. the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990], there would be ample scope for any unqualified and unregulated person to provide general assistance in litigation, secure in the knowledge that the litigant in person, if successful, would recover the cost of that assistance as a disbursement. It may be said that there is nothing wrong with that, since the court can exercise control by limiting recovery to what is reasonable and proportionate. But, important though this mechanism of control undoubtedly is, it would at best be an imperfect tool for controlling the activities of unskilled and unregulated persons, who are immune from the specific sanctions inherent in the wasted costs jurisdiction of the court. In any event, it should not be overlooked that most cases settle out of court. 
82 The obvious solution to the problems raised by this case is for an organisation such as the Chartered Institute of Taxation to become an 'authorised body' within the meaning of section 28(5) of the 1990 Act, and for those members who wish to conduct litigation to become authorised litigators and thereby 'legal representatives' within the meaning of CPR r 2.3(1). Section 28 would permit the institute to limit its application to a right to conduct a particular category of litigation, such as litigation falling within the scope of the permission granted by the Bar Council under the Licensed Access scheme. The reasonable and proportionate fees of any such litigator would be recoverable by a litigant in person as legal services under CPR r 48.6(3)(b)."
Mr John Machell QC, who appeared before us for the appellant, pointed out that CPR 46.5(3)(b) does not state that it applies only to services provided by lawyers qualified in England and Wales. While CPR 46.5(2) and 46.5(3)(a) use the term "legal representative", which refers to someone with a qualification in this jurisdiction, CPR 46.5(3)(b) does not, from which it is to be inferred (Mr Machell submitted) that the intention was that CPR 46.5(3)(b) could apply to legal services supplied by someone other than a "legal representative". What matters, Mr Machell maintained, is that the relevant services are rendered by a lawyer, not where the lawyer is qualified: the dividing line is between services provided by a lawyer (the costs of which are recoverable) and services provided by other professionals (the costs of which are not). A foreign lawyer, Mr Machell said, would need to be qualified and regulated as such in his home jurisdiction. The fact, therefore, that such a lawyer might not be amenable to regulation in this country in the same way as (say) a solicitor is not important or, at least, does not matter enough to outweigh the "strong policy reasons that favour the adoption of a broader, rather than a narrower, construction of CPR 46.5(3)(b)". In this connection, Mr Machell suggested that the rules should be read in a way that encourages, rather than discourages, litigants in person from obtaining legal assistance and that, from a litigant's point of view, there may be a very significant cost saving if services can be obtained from lawyers in a lower cost jurisdiction. Mr Machell noted, too, that, in an appropriate case, the Court could make a non-party costs order against a foreign lawyer pursuant to section 51 of the Senior Courts Act 1981.

 
As, however, was pointed out by Mr Andrew Twigger QC, who appeared for the respondent with Miss Narinder Jhittay, the construction of CPR 46.5(3)(b) for which Mr Machell contended would have surprising and unsatisfactory implications. It is apparent from the United Building and Plumbing Contractors and Agassi cases that sums paid to someone familiar with the relevant law and procedure of this jurisdiction will not be recoverable under CPR 46.5(3)(b) unless the individual was legally qualified. The fact that a tax adviser may have "specialist expertise" "far exceeding that of solicitors" will not avail a litigant in person, and it was common ground between the parties that a professor of law at a leading English university will be in the same position if he or she has not acquired a professional qualification. If, though, Mr Machell's argument were correct, a person with a legal qualification from anywhere in the world, who might come from a jurisdiction with quite different law and procedure from this one, who might have no knowledge at all of our law and procedure, who would not be subject to the same regulation as a lawyer practising in England and Wales and whose own jurisdiction could not be guaranteed to provide any equivalent protection, could supply "legal services" within the meaning of CPR 46.5(3)(b), with the result that a litigant in person could potentially recover the cost from another party.

 
In my view, Mr Machell's submissions are not well-founded. Although CPR 46.5(3)(b) does not state so expressly, it can be seen from the United Building and Plumbing Contractors and Agassi cases that "legal services" must be "provided by or under supervision of a lawyer". It is also, I think, implicit in the provision that the lawyer must be someone who can be expected to be competent to supply services "relating to the conduct of the proceedings", which will be proceedings in this jurisdiction. A lawyer qualified in England and Wales will be such a person, but a foreign lawyer will not. As the Judge said (in paragraph 17(ii) of his judgment), Dickinson Gleeson's position "so far as English proceedings are concerned is that of lay persons", and most foreign lawyers will know much less about the legal system of England and Wales than Dickinson Gleeson. In short, a foreign lawyer lacking a qualification in this jurisdiction cannot be regarded as a "lawyer" or, hence, providing "legal services" for the purposes of CPR 46.5(3)(b) as what matters in that context is expertise in the law and procedure governing the relevant proceedings, viz. that of England and Wales.

 
Contrary to Mr Machell's contentions, that conclusion appears to me to make sense in public policy terms. I agree with Mr Twigger's submission that the "true policy consideration in the interpretation of these rules is that those who provide advice and assistance in connection with litigation in this jurisdiction should be properly qualified, regulated and insured in this jurisdiction". The point derives support from the Agassi case, in which Dyson LJ expressed concern about the possibility of an "unqualified and unregulated person" assisting with litigation and considered that the Court's ability to limit recovery to what is reasonable and proportionate "would at best be an imperfect tool for controlling the activities of unskilled and unregulated persons" (see paragraph 81). Nor does reference to Lord Woolf's "Access to Justice Final Report" (published in 1996) help Mr Machell. Lord Woolf spoke (in paragraph 45 of chapter 7) of the desirability of "unbundling", in other words of "arrangements whereby litigants could undertake much of the preparation of their case but with access to legal advice and representation as necessary". That view is reflected in CPR 46.5(3)(b), which allows a litigant in person to recover the cost of obtaining assistance (including, but not limited to, advice) from a lawyer. There is, however, no reason to suppose that Lord Woolf had in mind the provision of assistance by a foreign lawyer.

 
In all the circumstances, the Judge was, in my view, correct. I would dismiss the appeal.

 
Lord Justice Longmore:
 

I agree.

Sir Ernest Ryder, Senior President: 
This is an application for permission to appeal against the order of the Divisional Court (Sales LJ, Whipple and Garnham JJ) which on 5 October 2017 dismissed Mr. Conway's claim for judicial review.  Mr. Conway sought a declaration under section 4(2) of the Human Rights Act 1998 ("HRA 1998") that section 2(1) of the Suicide Act 1961 ("SA 1961") is incompatible with his rights under article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights ("ECHR").

 
Mr. Conway has applied for expedition of the application for permission to appeal and, if permission is granted, the substantive appeal.

 
Background facts
This case concerns the issue of the provision of assistance to a person with a terminal degenerative disease who wishes to commit suicide, so as to be able to exercise control over the time of his death as the disease reaches its final stage.  It follows a line of cases which have addressed similar issues, in particular:

 
R (Pretty) v Director of Public Prosecutions [2001] UKHL 61; [2001] 1 AC 800 ("Pretty");
R (Purdy) v Director of Public Prosecutions [2009] UKHL 54; [2010] 1 AC 345 ("Purdy"): and
R (Nicklinson) v Ministry of Justice [2014] UKSC 38; [2015] AC 657 ("Nicklinson").
      Mr. Conway is 68.  He has suffered from a form of Motor Neurone Disease ("MND") since about 2012.  The average life expectancy of a person with MND is between two and five years.  Mr. Conway has to use a wheelchair and requires ever increasing levels of assistance with daily life, eating and bodily functions.  The muscles which allow Mr. Conway to breathe are wasting away.  He finds it difficult to breathe without mechanical assistance in the form of non-invasive ventilation ("NIV"), which he requires for an increasing number of hours each day.  Eventually, the brain's ability to start and control voluntary movement is lost.  As Mr. Conway says:  MND "is a relentless and merciless process of progressive deterioration".

 
When Mr. Conway has a prognosis of six months or less to live, he wishes to have the option of taking action to end his life at a time of his choosing.  He wishes to end his life in a way that is swift and dignified, which would involve the assistance of medical professionals.  Mr. Conway says that this is because:

 
		"At some point, my breathing will stop altogether or I will become so helpless that I will be effectively entombed in my own body.  I would not like to live like this.  I would find it a totally undignified state for me to live in.  I find the prospect of this state for me to live quite unacceptable and I wish to end my life when I feel it is the right moment to do so, in a way that is swift and dignified."
The common law confers rights on individuals to insist upon preservation and protection of their physical integrity.  An individual has an absolute right to refuse medical treatment.  Even if medical treatment is necessary to keep a person alive, he has the right to refuse it and to choose to die.  In this case, Mr. Conway has the option to insist on the refusal of his breathing equipment which would lead to his death.  The common law refusal of treatment by a patient is an example of an autonomous person's right to make a decision to die.

 
Assisted suicide is the act of deliberately assisting or encouraging another person to kill himself, with the final act resting with the person who is dying.  Assisted suicide is prohibited by section 2 SA 1961.  Mr. Conway's case is concerned with assisted suicide.  It is important to distinguish his case from euthanasia.

 
Euthanasia is the act of deliberately ending a person's life to relieve suffering.  The act of ending the person's life is done, not by the person concerned, but by an outside party (whether a doctor, relative or other person).  Euthanasia is illegal in England and Wales, and the person committing the act may be charged with murder or manslaughter.  Mr. Conway's case does not concern euthanasia.

 
Mr. Conway has taken a different approach to previous claimants in the key reported cases.  He provided for the court an alternative scheme supported by extensive expert evidence which he submits shows that the blanket prohibition in section 2 is an unnecessary and disproportionate interference with his rights under article 8.  The criteria outlined by Mr. Conway are that the prohibition on providing assistance for suicide should not apply where the individual:

Sir Ernest Ryder, Senior President: 
This is an application for permission to appeal against the order of the Divisional Court (Sales LJ, Whipple and Garnham JJ) which on 5 October 2017 dismissed Mr. Conway's claim for judicial review.  Mr. Conway sought a declaration under section 4(2) of the Human Rights Act 1998 ("HRA 1998") that section 2(1) of the Suicide Act 1961 ("SA 1961") is incompatible with his rights under article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights ("ECHR").

 
Mr. Conway has applied for expedition of the application for permission to appeal and, if permission is granted, the substantive appeal.

 
Background facts
This case concerns the issue of the provision of assistance to a person with a terminal degenerative disease who wishes to commit suicide, so as to be able to exercise control over the time of his death as the disease reaches its final stage.  It follows a line of cases which have addressed similar issues, in particular:

 
R (Pretty) v Director of Public Prosecutions [2001] UKHL 61; [2001] 1 AC 800 ("Pretty");
R (Purdy) v Director of Public Prosecutions [2009] UKHL 54; [2010] 1 AC 345 ("Purdy"): and
R (Nicklinson) v Ministry of Justice [2014] UKSC 38; [2015] AC 657 ("Nicklinson").
      Mr. Conway is 68.  He has suffered from a form of Motor Neurone Disease ("MND") since about 2012.  The average life expectancy of a person with MND is between two and five years.  Mr. Conway has to use a wheelchair and requires ever increasing levels of assistance with daily life, eating and bodily functions.  The muscles which allow Mr. Conway to breathe are wasting away.  He finds it difficult to breathe without mechanical assistance in the form of non-invasive ventilation ("NIV"), which he requires for an increasing number of hours each day.  Eventually, the brain's ability to start and control voluntary movement is lost.  As Mr. Conway says:  MND "is a relentless and merciless process of progressive deterioration".

 
When Mr. Conway has a prognosis of six months or less to live, he wishes to have the option of taking action to end his life at a time of his choosing.  He wishes to end his life in a way that is swift and dignified, which would involve the assistance of medical professionals.  Mr. Conway says that this is because:

 
		"At some point, my breathing will stop altogether or I will become so helpless that I will be effectively entombed in my own body.  I would not like to live like this.  I would find it a totally undignified state for me to live in.  I find the prospect of this state for me to live quite unacceptable and I wish to end my life when I feel it is the right moment to do so, in a way that is swift and dignified."

Lord Justice Flaux: 
Introduction
The appellant appeals with the permission of Hamblen LJ against the Order of Picken J dated 22 June 2016. By that Order the judge made orders and declarations that: (i) the Judgment dated 23 May 2014 of the District Court of Nicosia, Cyprus ("the Judgment") did not become immediately fully effective and enforceable by the appellant in England and Wales as a judgment of the High Court of Justice, Queen's Bench Division on the making of the Order of Master Leslie dated 26 February 2015 and would only become fully effective and enforceable on the final determination of the appeal against the Order of Master Leslie issued by the respondents on 22 April 2016; (ii) the appellant was prohibited from taking any "measures of enforcement" pursuant to and in reliance on paragraphs 1 and/or 4 of the Order of Master Leslie until the final determination of the appeal; and (iii) "measures of enforcement" include service of the Judgment and/or the Order of Master Leslie on, or notification or provision of the Judgment and/or the Order of Master Leslie to third parties to the present proceedings in order to give effect to the Judgment as a judgment of the High Court of Justice, Queen's Bench Division. 

 
As the judge said at the outset of his judgment, the case thus raises two interesting and apparently novel questions: (i) whether, in the case of a worldwide freezing order obtained in another member state, here Cyprus, the effect of obtaining an Order under Article 38 of Council Regulation (EC) 44/2001 ("the Judgments Regulation") such as was obtained from Master Leslie permitting the registration of that worldwide freezing order as a judgment of the High Court of Justice, Queen's Bench Division is that the worldwide freezing order becomes immediately effective and fully enforceable or whether it only becomes effective and fully enforceable if there is no appeal brought in respect of the registration order within two months of its being made or, if there is an appeal within that time, on determination of the appeal; and (ii)  whether "measures of enforcement" as referred to in Article 47(3) of the Judgments Regulation includes service of the worldwide freezing order on and/or notification of the worldwide freezing order to third parties or whether "measures of enforcement" are confined to processes in which the Court is involved in securing enforcement.

 
Factual background 
The factual background is essentially not in dispute and can be stated as follows.  The appellant is a registered Cypriot entity which until 2012 offered a full range of banking, insurance and financial services in Cyprus and abroad. Following the banking crisis in Cyprus, a Special Administrator was appointed and the appellant is now in a process called "resolution". On 26 November 2012, the appellant issued a writ of summons in the District Court of Nicosia against the first three respondents and eight others, some of whom were its former officers, claiming breach of fiduciary duty, breach of trust, abuse of position, conflict of interest, conspiracy and negligence. On 29 April 2013, that writ was amended to add Marfin (the fourth respondent) as a defendant and the appellant made an ex parte application to the District Court seeking worldwide freezing orders and discovery orders against the then defendants. On 8 May 2013 a worldwide freezing order was made on an interim basis up to 3.79 billion in the case of the first and second respondents and 1.5 billion in the case of the third respondent. The order also prohibited Marfin from transferring assets to the first three respondents. 

 
Applications were made by the first three respondents to set aside the proceedings and the worldwide freezing order which ultimately proved unsuccessful and, following an inter partes hearing, the District Court issued a final judgment making a final worldwide freezing order (which like the judge I will refer to as "the Cypriot Freezing Order") which will remain in force until the completion of the proceedings in Cyprus. The order deals with each of the respondents separately and provides in relation to each of the first three respondents: 

 
"iv (1) Save as provided in paragraph (2) above, the conditions of this Order do not affect or concern anybody outside the jurisdiction of the Courts of the Republic of Cyprus.
(2) The conditions of this Order affect the following persons which are found in a country or state outside the jurisdiction of the Courts of the Republic of Cyprus:

b Any person, including any banking institution or other financial organization, 

ii in relation to which this Order has been determined as being applicable and/or otherwise executable by the Courts of a country which has jurisdiction on the said person or on the assets of this person."
In [7] of his judgment, Picken J recorded that the first respondent (who is now deceased) and Marfin were claimants in an ICSID arbitration brought by them against the Republic of Cyprus and that in his witness statement Dr Karatzenis, Chief Legal Counsel of Marfin, went on to suggest that the claims in that arbitration cover the same ground as that covered by the claims made by the appellant against the respondents in the proceedings before the District Court. He went on to suggest that the Cypriot proceedings had been pursued by the appellant, which he described as being state-owned and state-controlled, as part of an attempt by the Republic of Cyprus to "hamper" the respondents' pursuit of the ICSID arbitration claim, and that the obtaining of the Cypriot Freezing Order, as well as its registration in this jurisdiction, also forms part of that attempt. As the judge said, this was not accepted by the appellant in its evidence and, in any event, is not relevant to the present issues.

 
On 12 February 2015, the appellant issued its application to the High Court of Justice, Queen's Bench Division to register the Cypriot Freezing Order as a judgment of the English Court under Article 38 of the Judgments Regulation. The matter came before Master Leslie on paper and, although the application would normally have been dealt with without a hearing, he endorsed the Application Notice: "See me in Practice, if so advised. See Art 31 of EC Reg 44/2001", as the judge said, a reference to the possibility of the appellant obtaining a domestic freezing order as a "protective measure" under Article 31 of the Judgments Regulation. 

 
At the subsequent hearing on 26 February 2015, Master Leslie raised this point with Mr Charles Samek QC, counsel for the appellant, and asked what the effect would be if the Cypriot Freezing Order were registered. Mr Samek QC's response was: "it would be as if it were an English freezing order and that  the Applicant was considering going off to the High Court to seek specific interim relief as would be available here against third parties". Master Leslie accepted that he had jurisdiction to make the registration order, as was also accepted by the respondents before Picken J. Under Article 32 of the Judgments Regulation the definition of "judgment" is wide enough to encompass a worldwide freezing order made after an inter partes hearing and there is authority from the European Court of Justice to that effect: Denilauler v SNC Couchet Frères [1980] ECR 1553. 

 
The Order of Master Leslie was in standard form and provided as follows: 

 
"1. The Judgment dated 23 May 2014 of the District Court of Nicosia, Cyprus, with Action No. 8400/2012 between the Claimant/Applicant and the Defendants/Respondents 1, 2, 3 and 12 (which itself made final and absolute until trial or further order the interim orders dated 8 May 2013 of the District Court of Nicosia, Cyprus, with Action No. 8400/2012 between the Claimant/Applicant and the Defendants/Respondents 1, 2, 3 and 12) may be registered as a judgment of the Queen's Bench Division of the High Court of Justice of England and Wales pursuant to Article 38 of the Judgments Regulation (Council Regulation (EC) No. 44/2001 of 22 December 2000), for enforcement in England and Wales.
2. Respondents 1, 2, 3 and 12 pay the Applicant's costs of this application to be assessed if not agreed, with a payment on account thereof to be made within 28 days of service of this order in the total sum of £10,000.00.
3. The party entitled to the benefit of the judgment is Cyprus Popular Bank Public Co Ltd (also known as 'Laiki') under resolution pursuant to the provisions of the Resolution of Credit and Other Institutions Law 2013 N. 17(I)/2013 (acting by its Special Administrator, Andri Antoniadou, from Nicosia, Cyprus) and its address for service within the jurisdiction is the address of its instructed solicitors Eversheds LLP at One Wood Street, London EC2W 7WS (Ref: FLACKD/300174.000001).
4. Respondents 1, 2, 3 and 12 have the right to appeal against this Order by making an appeal within 2 months after the date of service of this order on them. No measures of enforcement will be taken by the party entitled to the benefit of the judgment before the end of that period, other than measures ordered by the court to preserve the property of the judgment debtors."
Although the Registration Order was made in February 2015, the appellant did not seek to rely upon it for another twelve months until on 4 February 2016, the appellant's solicitors, DLA Piper LLP wrote to Union Bancaire Privée ("UBP"). Having referred to the Cypriot Freezing Order and its terms, the letter then referred to the Registration Order. It continued, so far as presently relevant: 

 
"7. We seek your written confirmation by 5 pm on 5 February 2016 that, in respect of any assets of the Defendants in your custody, possession or power, you will not permit the Defendants to remove these from England and Wales or to dispose or to deal with them or to diminish their value. In the absence of hearing from you, we may apply to the court without further notice to you.

9. For the avoidance of doubt, you are now considered to be on notice of each of the May 2013 Order, the Cypriot Judgment and the English Order. Should you fail to comply with the terms of those orders and judgment you may be found in contempt of court."
The Head of Legal and the Head of Compliance at UBP responded the following day confirming that the bank had notice of and would comply with the Order of the High Court registering the judgment of the District Court "with immediate effect". In a subsequent email on 25 February 2016, the Head of Legal said: "we are being told that the order is unenforceable in the UK as it has not been registered", to which the partner at DLA Piper LLP responded the following day, saying, inter alia: 

 
"While it is obviously not for us to advise you, our client's position is as follows:
1 By Order of the English Court dated 26 February 2015, the Judgment of the District Court of Nicosia in Action no. 8400/2012 dated 23 May 2014 (the 'Cypriot Judgment') was registered as a judgment of the High Court of England and Wales.
2 The effect of registration is that the Cypriot Judgment takes effect in England and Wales as though it were a judgment rendered by a Court in this jurisdiction. Accordingly, having received notice of it, UBP are bound by the English Order and must ensure that its terms are complied with.
3 Paragraph 4 of the English Order, which provides for certain of the Respondents to have a right of appeal, does not impact on the Order's validity or enforceability as against the Respondents (or you). The purpose of that provision is to allow a period in which enforcement against an executory judgment may not take place, but this does not impact on the prohibition on disposition, which is [a] measure designed to prevent the Respondents from taking any steps that may prejudice a final judgment. That prohibition falls within the category of 'measures ordered by the court to preserve the property of the judgment debtor'.
4 Accordingly, and as communicated to you in our letter of 4 February, our client's position is that the English Order is a fully effective and enforceable order of the English Court that is binding on UBP."
It is accepted by Mr Samek QC that the last sentence of paragraph 3 was incorrect. 
Following correspondence between the parties, the respondents' application which was before the judge was issued on 9 May 2016 and was heard on 10 and 17 June 2016. The judge having circulated his draft judgment to the parties in the usual way prior to hand down and Mr Samek QC having appreciated that he had lost, before the judgment was handed down on 22 June 2016, Mr Samek QC made an application for a domestic freezing order against the respondents as a "protective measure" under article 47(3) of the Judgments Convention. The judge granted that application and made a domestic freezing order. His judgment in relation to that application ([2016] EWHC 1695 (QB); [2017] QB 453 at 481-494) is not under appeal. That freezing order remains in force because, for reasons not currently relevant, the respondents' appeal against the Registration Order has yet to be heard. 

 
The legal framework
Before considering the judgment in more detail, it is necessary to consider the legal framework. The Judgments Regulation came into force on 1 March 2002 and had direct effect in the member states according to European Community law and had effect in English law by virtue of the European Communities Act 1972. 

 
Article 31 of the Judgments Regulation, in Chapter II "Jurisdiction", is headed: "Provisional, including protective measures" and provides: 

 
"Application may be made to the courts of a Member State for such provisional, including protective, measures as may be available under the law of that State, even if, under this Regulation, the courts of another Member State have jurisdiction as to the substance of the matter."
It thus reflects the earlier provision for "interim relief" to be available under section 25 of the Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments Act 1982.
The "Enforcement" section of Chapter III "Recognition and Enforcement" begins with Article 38 which provides: 

 
"1. A judgment given in a Member State and enforceable in that State shall be enforced in another Member State when, on the application of any interested party, it has been declared enforceable there.
2. However, in the United Kingdom, such a judgment shall be enforced in England and Wales, in Scotland, or in Northern Ireland when, on the application of any interested party, it has been registered for enforcement in that part of the United Kingdom."
Article 38.2 expressly recognises that unlike many other member states, the United Kingdom does not have the "exequatur" procedure, so that it is not necessary to apply for a declaration of enforceability under Article 38.1, hence only registration is required under Article 38.2. 

 
The relevant provisions in Articles 40 to 43 are: 

 
"Article 40.1
The procedure for making the application shall be governed by the law of the Member State in which enforcement is sought.
Article 41
The judgment shall be declared enforceable immediately on completion of the formalities in Article 53 without any review under Articles 34 and 35. The party against whom enforcement is sought shall not at this stage of the proceedings be entitled to make any submissions on the application.
Article 42.1
The decision on the application for a declaration of enforceability shall forthwith be brought to the notice of the applicant in accordance with the procedure laid down by the law of the Member State in which enforcement is sought.
Article 43.1
The decision on the application for a declaration of enforceability may be appealed against by either party."
Article 47 then provides: 

 
"1. When a judgment must be recognised in accordance with this Regulation, nothing shall prevent the applicant from availing himself of provisional, including protective, measures in accordance with the law of the Member State requested without a declaration of enforceability under Article 41 being required.
2. The declaration of enforceability shall carry with it the power to proceed to any protective measures.
3. During the time specified for an appeal pursuant to Article 43(5) against the declaration of enforceability and until any such appeal has been determined, no measures of enforcement may be taken other than protective measures against the property of the party against whom enforcement is sought."
It is noticeable that all these Articles refer only to the procedure for declarations of enforceability and do not refer to the procedure of registration applicable under Article 38.2 in the United Kingdom, but any question as to their applicability to the procedure of registration is answered by the relevant Order in Council, the Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments Order 2001 (SI 2001/3929), to which the judge was not referred, which contains provisions as to the effect of registration and the right of appeal. Paragraph 2 of the Order provides: 

 
"(1) In this Order 
"the Act" means the Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments Act 1982; 
"the Regulation" means Council Regulation (EC) No. 44/2001 of 22nd December 2000 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters;"
Paragraph 3 provides: 

 
"Schedule 1 to this Order (which applies certain provisions of the Act with modifications for the purposes of the Regulation) shall have effect."
The critical provision of Schedule 1 which is headed "the Regulation" is paragraph 2, headed: "Enforcement of judgments other than maintenance orders (section 4) [i.e. section 4 of the Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments Act 1982]. Paragraphs 2(2) and (3) provide: 

 
"(2) A judgment registered under the Regulation shall, for the purposes of its enforcement, be of the same force and effect, the registering court shall have in relation to its enforcement the same powers, and proceedings for or with respect to its enforcement may be taken, as if the judgment had been originally given by the registering court and had (where relevant) been entered. 
(3) Sub-paragraph (2) is subject to Article 47 (restriction on enforcement where appeal pending or time for appeal unexpired), to paragraph 5 and to any provision made by rules of court as to the manner in which and conditions subject to which a judgment registered under the Regulation may be enforced." 
The Rules of Court which were made as contemplated by paragraph 2(3) of Schedule 1 were contained in CPR Part 74, the relevant provisions of which were introduced by the Civil Procedure (Amendment) Rules 2002 SI 2002/2058. So far as registration of judgments under the Judgments Regulation is concerned, those Rules provided as follows: 

 
"Registration Orders
74.6(1) An order granting permission to register a judgment ("registration order") must be drawn up by the judgment creditor and served on the judgment debtor
(3) A registration order must state 
(a) full particulars of the judgment registered;
(b) the name of the judgment creditor and his address for service within the jurisdiction;
(c) the right of the judgment debtor

 (ii) in the case of registration following an application under the 1982 Act or under the Judgments Regulation, to appeal against the registration order;
(d) the period within which such an appeal may be made; and
(e) that no measures of enforcement will be taken before the end of that period, other than measures ordered by the court to preserve the property of the judgment debtor. 
Appeals
74.8(1) An appeal against the granting or the refusal of registration under the 1982 Act or the Judgments Regulation must be made in accordance with Part 52, subject to the following provisions of this rule
(4) The appellant's notice must be served 
(a) where the appeal is against the granting of registration, within

 (ii) where service is to be effected on a party not domiciled within the jurisdiction, two months, of service of the registration order;
Enforcement
74.9(1) No steps may be taken to enforce a judgment 
(a) before the end of the period specified in accordance with rule 74.6(3)(d), or that period as extended by the court; or
(b) where there is an application under rule 74.7 or an appeal under rule 74.8, until the application or appeal has been determined.
(2) Any party wishing to enforce a judgment must file evidence of the service on the judgment debtor of 
(a) the registration order; and
(b) any other relevant order of the court.
(3) Nothing in this rule prevents the court from making orders to preserve the property of the judgment debtor pending final determination of any issue relating to the enforcement of the judgment."
The judgment below
The judge produced a careful and closely reasoned judgment on the two questions I identified at [2] above. In relation to the first question, as to the enforceability of the Cypriot Freezing Order as an English judgment, at [26] the judge said:

 
"Commonsense seems to me to dictate that if "measures of enforcement" cannot be taken, then, the "judgment" is not, in a real and practical sense, fully effective and enforceable. Put another way, it is difficult to see how a claimant could say, on the one hand, that it has a "judgment" which is enforceable whilst also saying, on the other hand, that it cannot take "measures of enforcement" in relation to that "judgment". " 
At [27] the judge went on to accept the submissions advanced by Mr Ali Malek QC, on behalf of the respondents, that the quid pro quo for the streamlined procedure set out in the Judgments Regulation was that a claimant cannot proceed to enforce a judgment until the defendant has had the opportunity to bring an appeal. He went on to hold at [28]: 

 
"Furthermore, I struggle to see why a claimant which has obtained a declaration of enforceability should find itself in a better position pending an appeal, or in the two month period when an appeal can be brought if an appeal is, in the event, not brought, than a claimant would be in if an appeal were to be brought within the two month period and that appeal were to prove to be successful. Until it is known whether an appeal is to be brought and, if it is, whether it is going to succeed, it seems to me that it is appropriate that the position should, in effect, be neutral. The logical consequence of Mr Samek QC's and Mr McWilliams's submission being accepted is, however, that the claimant is in a better position simply by dint of having obtained a registration order on a without notice basis, and nothing more than that. I see no justification for adopting such an approach. This is all the more the case, given that Articles 47.2 and 47.3 both expressly permit a claimant, having obtained a registration order or, more accurately, using the language of Articles 47.2 and 47.3, a "declaration of enforceability", to take "protective measures", in the case of Article 47.3 specifically pending the resolution of any appeal. In view of this, pending an appeal a claimant has an appropriate level of protection and its position is safeguarded, provided obviously that it can persuade the Court in this jurisdiction to grant it relevant protective relief. In my view, there can be no justification for Article 38 effectively being used in such circumstances as, to use Mr Malek QC's and Mr Evans's label, a "short cut" to the obtaining of a freezing order in this jurisdiction. It cannot be right, and it would be wholly at odds with the scheme of the Judgments Regulation, were a claimant to be able to achieve the immediate freezing of bank accounts in this jurisdiction by obtaining an order pursuant to Article 38 without, pending an appeal, having to persuade the Court (in this jurisdiction) that it ought itself to grant a freezing order on conventional grounds."
He set out his conclusion at [30]: 

 
"My conclusion, in the circumstances, is that the Cypriot Freezing Order is not currently fully effective and enforceable, and nor did it become fully effective and enforceable on the making of the Registration Order, but that it will only become fully effective and enforceable on determination of the Defendants' appeal against the Registration Order. It follows from this that I reject the submission made by Mr Samek QC and Mr McWilliams that, by virtue of what was stated in the Cypriot Freezing Order about it applying to "Any person, including any banking institution or other financial organization, in relation to which this Order has been determined as being applicable and/or otherwise executable by the Courts of a country which has jurisdiction on the said person or on the assets of this person", the Cypriot Freezing Order is currently fully effective and enforceable as regards UBP in accordance with its terms. I do not consider, in the circumstances, that it can be right to suggest that it "has been determined" in this jurisdiction that the Cypriot Freezing Order is "applicable" or that it is "otherwise executable". All that has so far happened is that the Claimant has obtained an order on a without notice basis and, in circumstances, where the Defendants are seeking to appeal against the Registration Order."
Although he had reached that conclusion without reference to authority, the judge went on to hold that his approach was supported by two authorities. The first was the decision of the European Court of Justice in Calzaturificio Brennero S.A.S. v Wendel GmbH Schuhproduktion International (Case 258/83) [1986] 2 CMLR 59, which considered the predecessor of Article 47(3) of the Judgments Regulation, Article 39 of the Brussels Convention. The judge relied particularly on certain passages from the Opinion of the Advocate General, Sir Gordon Slynn: 

 
"By 'protective measures' Article 39 of the Convention envisages those forms of relief available under the law of the enforcing State to prevent the judgment debtor from removing the assets on which execution is to be levied. By 'measures of enforcement' which may not be taken, Article 39 means, in consequence, all other measures of enforcement, which usually take the form of the sequestration of the judgment debtor's property. 
 The object of Article 39 is 'to ensure at the enforcement stage a balance between the rights and interests of the parties concerned, in order to avoid either of them suffering any loss as a result of the operation of the rules of procedure'. That balance may be safeguarded, not threatened, by the adoption of protective measures. Article 39, thus, does not exclude protective measures which have the same effect as an order for protective measures in the judgment sought to be enforced merely because they do give effect to that order. These are not the sort of measures which are prohibited by Article 39."
The judge relied upon these passages as emphasising the striking of a balance between the interests of the defendant and of the claimant, which he held involves in the case of the defendant, the right to appeal and in the case of the claimant, the ability to take protective measures.

 
The other authority which the judge considered supported his approach is the decision of the Court of Appeal in Banco Nacional de Comercio Exterior SNC v Empresa De Telecommunicaciones De Cuba SA [2007] EWCA Civ 662; [2008] 1 WLR 1936, in particular those passages in the judgment of the Court given by Tuckey LJ at [25] and [44]-[45] discussing Article 47. The judge placed particular emphasis on the latter passages where Tuckey LJ underlined that "protective measures" will only be granted in accordance with the law of the member state in which the judgment was sought to be registered. At [34] the judge relied upon this as demonstrating that there was nothing remarkable about the appellant being under an obligation to make a separate freezing order application by way of protective measures under Article 47(3) even though the judgment registered was the Cypriot Freezing Order. 

 
In relation to the second question set out at [2] above, the judge accepted Mr Malek QC's submission that "in any ordinary sense" the appellant had effectively enforced the terms of the Cypriot Freezing Order and the Registration Order by serving them on UBP and seeking compliance with them by UBP. As the judge put it at [35]: 

 
"in effect insisting on the immediate freezing of UBP's bank accounts in the face of a threat of immediate contempt proceedings. In context, bearing in mind that the underlying "judgment" is a worldwide freezing order, I am confident that what the Claimant has done in the present case amounts to a "measure of enforcement". As the Advocate-General observed in his opinion in the Brennero]
[
Lord Justice Flaux: 
Introduction
The appellant appeals with the permission of Hamblen LJ against the Order of Picken J dated 22 June 2016. By that Order the judge made orders and declarations that: (i) the Judgment dated 23 May 2014 of the District Court of Nicosia, Cyprus ("the Judgment") did not become immediately fully effective and enforceable by the appellant in England and Wales as a judgment of the High Court of Justice, Queen's Bench Division on the making of the Order of Master Leslie dated 26 February 2015 and would only become fully effective and enforceable on the final determination of the appeal against the Order of Master Leslie issued by the respondents on 22 April 2016; (ii) the appellant was prohibited from taking any "measures of enforcement" pursuant to and in reliance on paragraphs 1 and/or 4 of the Order of Master Leslie until the final determination of the appeal; and (iii) "measures of enforcement" include service of the Judgment and/or the Order of Master Leslie on, or notification or provision of the Judgment and/or the Order of Master Leslie to third parties to the present proceedings in order to give effect to the Judgment as a judgment of the High Court of Justice, Queen's Bench Division. 

 
As the judge said at the outset of his judgment, the case thus raises two interesting and apparently novel questions: (i) whether, in the case of a worldwide freezing order obtained in another member state, here Cyprus, the effect of obtaining an Order under Article 38 of Council Regulation (EC) 44/2001 ("the Judgments Regulation") such as was obtained from Master Leslie permitting the registration of that worldwide freezing order as a judgment of the High Court of Justice, Queen's Bench Division is that the worldwide freezing order becomes immediately effective and fully enforceable or whether it only becomes effective and fully enforceable if there is no appeal brought in respect of the registration order within two months of its being made or, if there is an appeal within that time, on determination of the appeal; and (ii)  whether "measures of enforcement" as referred to in Article 47(3) of the Judgments Regulation includes service of the worldwide freezing order on and/or notification of the worldwide freezing order to third parties or whether "measures of enforcement" are confined to processes in which the Court is involved in securing enforcement.

 
Factual background 
The factual background is essentially not in dispute and can be stated as follows.  The appellant is a registered Cypriot entity which until 2012 offered a full range of banking, insurance and financial services in Cyprus and abroad. Following the banking crisis in Cyprus, a Special Administrator was appointed and the appellant is now in a process called "resolution". On 26 November 2012, the appellant issued a writ of summons in the District Court of Nicosia against the first three respondents and eight others, some of whom were its former officers, claiming breach of fiduciary duty, breach of trust, abuse of position, conflict of interest, conspiracy and negligence. On 29 April 2013, that writ was amended to add Marfin (the fourth respondent) as a defendant and the appellant made an ex parte application to the District Court seeking worldwide freezing orders and discovery orders against the then defendants. On 8 May 2013 a worldwide freezing order was made on an interim basis up to 3.79 billion in the case of the first and second respondents and 1.5 billion in the case of the third respondent. The order also prohibited Marfin from transferring assets to the first three respondents. 

 
Applications were made by the first three respondents to set aside the proceedings and the worldwide freezing order which ultimately proved unsuccessful and, following an inter partes hearing, the District Court issued a final judgment making a final worldwide freezing order (which like the judge I will refer to as "the Cypriot Freezing Order") which will remain in force until the completion of the proceedings in Cyprus. The order deals with each of the respondents separately and provides in relation to each of the first three respondents: 

 
"iv (1) Save as provided in paragraph (2) above, the conditions of this Order do not affect or concern anybody outside the jurisdiction of the Courts of the Republic of Cyprus.
(2) The conditions of this Order affect the following persons which are found in a country or state outside the jurisdiction of the Courts of the Republic of Cyprus:

b Any person, including any banking institution or other financial organization, 

ii in relation to which this Order has been determined as being applicable and/or otherwise executable by the Courts of a country which has jurisdiction on the said person or on the assets of this person."
In [7] of his judgment, Picken J recorded that the first respondent (who is now deceased) and Marfin were claimants in an ICSID arbitration brought by them against the Republic of Cyprus and that in his witness statement Dr Karatzenis, Chief Legal Counsel of Marfin, went on to suggest that the claims in that arbitration cover the same ground as that covered by the claims made by the appellant against the respondents in the proceedings before the District Court. He went on to suggest that the Cypriot proceedings had been pursued by the appellant, which he described as being state-owned and state-controlled, as part of an attempt by the Republic of Cyprus to "hamper" the respondents' pursuit of the ICSID arbitration claim, and that the obtaining of the Cypriot Freezing Order, as well as its registration in this jurisdiction, also forms part of that attempt. As the judge said, this was not accepted by the appellant in its evidence and, in any event, is not relevant to the present issues.

 
On 12 February 2015, the appellant issued its application to the High Court of Justice, Queen's Bench Division to register the Cypriot Freezing Order as a judgment of the English Court under Article 38 of the Judgments Regulation. The matter came before Master Leslie on paper and, although the application would normally have been dealt with without a hearing, he endorsed the Application Notice: "See me in Practice, if so advised. See Art 31 of EC Reg 44/2001", as the judge said, a reference to the possibility of the appellant obtaining a domestic freezing order as a "protective measure" under Article 31 of the Judgments Regulation. 

 
At the subsequent hearing on 26 February 2015, Master Leslie raised this point with Mr Charles Samek QC, counsel for the appellant, and asked what the effect would be if the Cypriot Freezing Order were registered. Mr Samek QC's response was: "it would be as if it were an English freezing order and that  the Applicant was considering going off to the High Court to seek specific interim relief as would be available here against third parties". Master Leslie accepted that he had jurisdiction to make the registration order, as was also accepted by the respondents before Picken J. Under Article 32 of the Judgments Regulation the definition of "judgment" is wide enough to encompass a worldwide freezing order made after an inter partes hearing and there is authority from the European Court of Justice to that effect: Denilauler v SNC Couchet Frères [1980] ECR 1553. 

 
The Order of Master Leslie was in standard form and provided as follows: 

 
"1. The Judgment dated 23 May 2014 of the District Court of Nicosia, Cyprus, with Action No. 8400/2012 between the Claimant/Applicant and the Defendants/Respondents 1, 2, 3 and 12 (which itself made final and absolute until trial or further order the interim orders dated 8 May 2013 of the District Court of Nicosia, Cyprus, with Action No. 8400/2012 between the Claimant/Applicant and the Defendants/Respondents 1, 2, 3 and 12) may be registered as a judgment of the Queen's Bench Division of the High Court of Justice of England and Wales pursuant to Article 38 of the Judgments Regulation (Council Regulation (EC) No. 44/2001 of 22 December 2000), for enforcement in England and Wales.
2. Respondents 1, 2, 3 and 12 pay the Applicant's costs of this application to be assessed if not agreed, with a payment on account thereof to be made within 28 days of service of this order in the total sum of £10,000.00.
3. The party entitled to the benefit of the judgment is Cyprus Popular Bank Public Co Ltd (also known as 'Laiki') under resolution pursuant to the provisions of the Resolution of Credit and Other Institutions Law 2013 N. 17(I)/2013 (acting by its Special Administrator, Andri Antoniadou, from Nicosia, Cyprus) and its address for service within the jurisdiction is the address of its instructed solicitors Eversheds LLP at One Wood Street, London EC2W 7WS (Ref: FLACKD/300174.000001).
4. Respondents 1, 2, 3 and 12 have the right to appeal against this Order by making an appeal within 2 months after the date of service of this order on them. No measures of enforcement will be taken by the party entitled to the benefit of the judgment before the end of that period, other than measures ordered by the court to preserve the property of the judgment debtors."
Although the Registration Order was made in February 2015, the appellant did not seek to rely upon it for another twelve months until on 4 February 2016, the appellant's solicitors, DLA Piper LLP wrote to Union Bancaire Privée ("UBP"). Having referred to the Cypriot Freezing Order and its terms, the letter then referred to the Registration Order. It continued, so far as presently relevant: 

 
"7. We seek your written confirmation by 5 pm on 5 February 2016 that, in respect of any assets of the Defendants in your custody, possession or power, you will not permit the Defendants to remove these from England and Wales or to dispose or to deal with them or to diminish their value. In the absence of hearing from you, we may apply to the court without further notice to you.

9. For the avoidance of doubt, you are now considered to be on notice of each of the May 2013 Order, the Cypriot Judgment and the English Order. Should you fail to comply with the terms of those orders and judgment you may be found in contempt of court."
The Head of Legal and the Head of Compliance at UBP responded the following day confirming that the bank had notice of and would comply with the Order of the High Court registering the judgment of the District Court "with immediate effect". In a subsequent email on 25 February 2016, the Head of Legal said: "we are being told that the order is unenforceable in the UK as it has not been registered", to which the partner at DLA Piper LLP responded the following day, saying, inter alia: 

 
"While it is obviously not for us to advise you, our client's position is as follows:
1 By Order of the English Court dated 26 February 2015, the Judgment of the District Court of Nicosia in Action no. 8400/2012 dated 23 May 2014 (the 'Cypriot Judgment') was registered as a judgment of the High Court of England and Wales.
2 The effect of registration is that the Cypriot Judgment takes effect in England and Wales as though it were a judgment rendered by a Court in this jurisdiction. Accordingly, having received notice of it, UBP are bound by the English Order and must ensure that its terms are complied with.
3 Paragraph 4 of the English Order, which provides for certain of the Respondents to have a right of appeal, does not impact on the Order's validity or enforceability as against the Respondents (or you). The purpose of that provision is to allow a period in which enforcement against an executory judgment may not take place, but this does not impact on the prohibition on disposition, which is [a] measure designed to prevent the Respondents from taking any steps that may prejudice a final judgment. That prohibition falls within the category of 'measures ordered by the court to preserve the property of the judgment debtor'.
4 Accordingly, and as communicated to you in our letter of 4 February, our client's position is that the English Order is a fully effective and enforceable order of the English Court that is binding on UBP."
It is accepted by Mr Samek QC that the last sentence of paragraph 3 was incorrect. 
Following correspondence between the parties, the respondents' application which was before the judge was issued on 9 May 2016 and was heard on 10 and 17 June 2016. The judge having circulated his draft judgment to the parties in the usual way prior to hand down and Mr Samek QC having appreciated that he had lost, before the judgment was handed down on 22 June 2016, Mr Samek QC made an application for a domestic freezing order against the respondents as a "protective measure" under article 47(3) of the Judgments Convention. The judge granted that application and made a domestic freezing order. His judgment in relation to that application ([2016] EWHC 1695 (QB); [2017] QB 453 at 481-494) is not under appeal. That freezing order remains in force because, for reasons not currently relevant, the respondents' appeal against the Registration Order has yet to be heard. 

 
The legal framework
Before considering the judgment in more detail, it is necessary to consider the legal framework. The Judgments Regulation came into force on 1 March 2002 and had direct effect in the member states according to European Community law and had effect in English law by virtue of the European Communities Act 1972. 

 
Article 31 of the Judgments Regulation, in Chapter II "Jurisdiction", is headed: "Provisional, including protective measures" and provides: 

 
"Application may be made to the courts of a Member State for such provisional, including protective, measures as may be available under the law of that State, even if, under this Regulation, the courts of another Member State have jurisdiction as to the substance of the matter."
It thus reflects the earlier provision for "interim relief" to be available under section 25 of the Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments Act 1982.
The "Enforcement" section of Chapter III "Recognition and Enforcement" begins with Article 38 which provides: 

 
"1. A judgment given in a Member State and enforceable in that State shall be enforced in another Member State when, on the application of any interested party, it has been declared enforceable there.
2. However, in the United Kingdom, such a judgment shall be enforced in England and Wales, in Scotland, or in Northern Ireland when, on the application of any interested party, it has been registered for enforcement in that part of the United Kingdom."
Article 38.2 expressly recognises that unlike many other member states, the United Kingdom does not have the "exequatur" procedure, so that it is not necessary to apply for a declaration of enforceability under Article 38.1, hence only registration is required under Article 38.2. 

 
The relevant provisions in Articles 40 to 43 are: 

 
"Article 40.1
The procedure for making the application shall be governed by the law of the Member State in which enforcement is sought.
Article 41
The judgment shall be declared enforceable immediately on completion of the formalities in Article 53 without any review under Articles 34 and 35. The party against whom enforcement is sought shall not at this stage of the proceedings be entitled to make any submissions on the application.
Article 42.1
The decision on the application for a declaration of enforceability shall forthwith be brought to the notice of the applicant in accordance with the procedure laid down by the law of the Member State in which enforcement is sought.
Article 43.1
The decision on the application for a declaration of enforceability may be appealed against by either party."
Article 47 then provides: 

 
"1. When a judgment must be recognised in accordance with this Regulation, nothing shall prevent the applicant from availing himself of provisional, including protective, measures in accordance with the law of the Member State requested without a declaration of enforceability under Article 41 being required.
2. The declaration of enforceability shall carry with it the power to proceed to any protective measures.
3. During the time specified for an appeal pursuant to Article 43(5) against the declaration of enforceability and until any such appeal has been determined, no measures of enforcement may be taken other than protective measures against the property of the party against whom enforcement is sought."
It is noticeable that all these Articles refer only to the procedure for declarations of enforceability and do not refer to the procedure of registration applicable under Article 38.2 in the United Kingdom, but any question as to their applicability to the procedure of registration is answered by the relevant Order in Council, the Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments Order 2001 (SI 2001/3929), to which the judge was not referred, which contains provisions as to the effect of registration and the right of appeal. Paragraph 2 of the Order provides: 

 
"(1) In this Order 
"the Act" means the Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments Act 1982; 
"the Regulation" means Council Regulation (EC) No. 44/2001 of 22nd December 2000 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters;"
Paragraph 3 provides: 

 
"Schedule 1 to this Order (which applies certain provisions of the Act with modifications for the purposes of the Regulation) shall have effect."
The critical provision of Schedule 1 which is headed "the Regulation" is paragraph 2, headed: "Enforcement of judgments other than maintenance orders (section 4) [i.e. section 4 of the Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments Act 1982]. Paragraphs 2(2) and (3) provide: 

 
"(2) A judgment registered under the Regulation shall, for the purposes of its enforcement, be of the same force and effect, the registering court shall have in relation to its enforcement the same powers, and proceedings for or with respect to its enforcement may be taken, as if the judgment had been originally given by the registering court and had (where relevant) been entered. 
(3) Sub-paragraph (2) is subject to Article 47 (restriction on enforcement where appeal pending or time for appeal unexpired), to paragraph 5 and to any provision made by rules of court as to the manner in which and conditions subject to which a judgment registered under the Regulation may be enforced." 
The Rules of Court which were made as contemplated by paragraph 2(3) of Schedule 1 were contained in CPR Part 74, the relevant provisions of which were introduced by the Civil Procedure (Amendment) Rules 2002 SI 2002/2058. So far as registration of judgments under the Judgments Regulation is concerned, those Rules provided as follows: 

 
"Registration Orders
74.6(1) An order granting permission to register a judgment ("registration order") must be drawn up by the judgment creditor and served on the judgment debtor
(3) A registration order must state 
(a) full particulars of the judgment registered;
(b) the name of the judgment creditor and his address for service within the jurisdiction;
(c) the right of the judgment debtor

 (ii) in the case of registration following an application under the 1982 Act or under the Judgments Regulation, to appeal against the registration order;
(d) the period within which such an appeal may be made; and
(e) that no measures of enforcement will be taken before the end of that period, other than measures ordered by the court to preserve the property of the judgment debtor. 
Appeals
74.8(1) An appeal against the granting or the refusal of registration under the 1982 Act or the Judgments Regulation must be made in accordance with Part 52, subject to the following provisions of this rule
(4) The appellant's notice must be served 
(a) where the appeal is against the granting of registration, within

 (ii) where service is to be effected on a party not domiciled within the jurisdiction, two months, of service of the registration order;
Enforcement
74.9(1) No steps may be taken to enforce a judgment 
(a) before the end of the period specified in accordance with rule 74.6(3)(d), or that period as extended by the court; or
(b) where there is an application under rule 74.7 or an appeal under rule 74.8, until the application or appeal has been determined.
(2) Any party wishing to enforce a judgment must file evidence of the service on the judgment debtor of 
(a) the registration order; and
(b) any other relevant order of the court.
(3) Nothing in this rule prevents the court from making orders to preserve the property of the judgment debtor pending final determination of any issue relating to the enforcement of the judgment."
The judgment below
The judge produced a careful and closely reasoned judgment on the two questions I identified at [2] above. In relation to the first question, as to the enforceability of the Cypriot Freezing Order as an English judgment, at [26] the judge said:

 
"Commonsense seems to me to dictate that if "measures of enforcement" cannot be taken, then, the "judgment" is not, in a real and practical sense, fully effective and enforceable. Put another way, it is difficult to see how a claimant could say, on the one hand, that it has a "judgment" which is enforceable whilst also saying, on the other hand, that it cannot take "measures of enforcement" in relation to that "judgment". " 
At [27] the judge went on to accept the submissions advanced by Mr Ali Malek QC, on behalf of the respondents, that the quid pro quo for the streamlined procedure set out in the Judgments Regulation was that a claimant cannot proceed to enforce a judgment until the defendant has had the opportunity to bring an appeal. He went on to hold at [28]: 

 
"Furthermore, I struggle to see why a claimant which has obtained a declaration of enforceability should find itself in a better position pending an appeal, or in the two month period when an appeal can be brought if an appeal is, in the event, not brought, than a claimant would be in if an appeal were to be brought within the two month period and that appeal were to prove to be successful. Until it is known whether an appeal is to be brought and, if it is, whether it is going to succeed, it seems to me that it is appropriate that the position should, in effect, be neutral. The logical consequence of Mr Samek QC's and Mr McWilliams's submission being accepted is, however, that the claimant is in a better position simply by dint of having obtained a registration order on a without notice basis, and nothing more than that. I see no justification for adopting such an approach. This is all the more the case, given that Articles 47.2 and 47.3 both expressly permit a claimant, having obtained a registration order or, more accurately, using the language of Articles 47.2 and 47.3, a "declaration of enforceability", to take "protective measures", in the case of Article 47.3 specifically pending the resolution of any appeal. In view of this, pending an appeal a claimant has an appropriate level of protection and its position is safeguarded, provided obviously that it can persuade the Court in this jurisdiction to grant it relevant protective relief. In my view, there can be no justification for Article 38 effectively being used in such circumstances as, to use Mr Malek QC's and Mr Evans's label, a "short cut" to the obtaining of a freezing order in this jurisdiction. It cannot be right, and it would be wholly at odds with the scheme of the Judgments Regulation, were a claimant to be able to achieve the immediate freezing of bank accounts in this jurisdiction by obtaining an order pursuant to Article 38 without, pending an appeal, having to persuade the Court (in this jurisdiction) that it ought itself to grant a freezing order on conventional grounds."
He set out his conclusion at [30]: 

 
"My conclusion, in the circumstances, is that the Cypriot Freezing Order is not currently fully effective and enforceable, and nor did it become fully effective and enforceable on the making of the Registration Order, but that it will only become fully effective and enforceable on determination of the Defendants' appeal against the Registration Order. It follows from this that I reject the submission made by Mr Samek QC and Mr McWilliams that, by virtue of what was stated in the Cypriot Freezing Order about it applying to "Any person, including any banking institution or other financial organization, in relation to which this Order has been determined as being applicable and/or otherwise executable by the Courts of a country which has jurisdiction on the said person or on the assets of this person", the Cypriot Freezing Order is currently fully effective and enforceable as regards UBP in accordance with its terms. I do not consider, in the circumstances, that it can be right to suggest that it "has been determined" in this jurisdiction that the Cypriot Freezing Order is "applicable" or that it is "otherwise executable". All that has so far happened is that the Claimant has obtained an order on a without notice basis and, in circumstances, where the Defendants are seeking to appeal against the Registration Order."
Although he had reached that conclusion without reference to authority, the judge went on to hold that his approach was supported by two authorities. The first was the decision of the European Court of Justice in Calzaturificio Brennero S.A.S. v Wendel GmbH Schuhproduktion International (Case 258/83) [1986] 2 CMLR 59, which considered the predecessor of Article 47(3) of the Judgments Regulation, Article 39 of the Brussels Convention. The judge relied particularly on certain passages from the Opinion of the Advocate General, Sir Gordon Slynn: 

 
"By 'protective measures' Article 39 of the Convention envisages those forms of relief available under the law of the enforcing State to prevent the judgment debtor from removing the assets on which execution is to be levied. By 'measures of enforcement' which may not be taken, Article 39 means, in consequence, all other measures of enforcement, which usually take the form of the sequestration of the judgment debtor's property. 
 The object of Article 39 is 'to ensure at the enforcement stage a balance between the rights and interests of the parties concerned, in order to avoid either of them suffering any loss as a result of the operation of the rules of procedure'. That balance may be safeguarded, not threatened, by the adoption of protective measures. Article 39, thus, does not exclude protective measures which have the same effect as an order for protective measures in the judgment sought to be enforced merely because they do give effect to that order. These are not the sort of measures which are prohibited by Article 39."
The judge relied upon these passages as emphasising the striking of a balance between the interests of the defendant and of the claimant, which he held involves in the case of the defendant, the right to appeal and in the case of the claimant, the ability to take protective measures.

 
The other authority which the judge considered supported his approach is the decision of the Court of Appeal in Banco Nacional de Comercio Exterior SNC v Empresa De Telecommunicaciones De Cuba SA [2007] EWCA Civ 662; [2008] 1 WLR 1936, in particular those passages in the judgment of the Court given by Tuckey LJ at [25] and [44]-[45] discussing Article 47. The judge placed particular emphasis on the latter passages where Tuckey LJ underlined that "protective measures" will only be granted in accordance with the law of the member state in which the judgment was sought to be registered. At [34] the judge relied upon this as demonstrating that there was nothing remarkable about the appellant being under an obligation to make a separate freezing order application by way of protective measures under Article 47(3) even though the judgment registered was the Cypriot Freezing Order. 

 
In relation to the second question set out at [2] above, the judge accepted Mr Malek QC's submission that "in any ordinary sense" the appellant had effectively enforced the terms of the Cypriot Freezing Order and the Registration Order by serving them on UBP and seeking compliance with them by UBP. As the judge put it at [35]: 

 
"in effect insisting on the immediate freezing of UBP's bank accounts in the face of a threat of immediate contempt proceedings. In context, bearing in mind that the underlying "judgment" is a worldwide freezing order, I am confident that what the Claimant has done in the present case amounts to a "measure of enforcement". As the Advocate-General observed in his opinion in the Brennero]
