THE MASTER OF THE ROLLS:    This is an unusual case.      In December 1950 Mr Sidnell v Wilson, who was a tobacconist, owned a couple of shops at Sudbury in Suffolk.      One of them, No.11a North Street, he occupied himself for the purpose of his tobacconist's business. The shop next door, No 11,  he let off to a Mr Carver, who was a Butcher, for twenty-one years at a rent of Â£156 a year.      He took a covenant by the tenant to keep the premises in good and tenantable repair, damage by fire excepted.      But the landlord himself covenanted to keep the roof and the exterior of the premises in good and tenantable repair and particularly" to do such structural repairs to the building as may be necessary for the convenient occupation thereof".      There was a covenant by the tenant to reside personally on the premises.

It appears that in June 1962 there was a serious fire in some houses a little further along the street.      then the fire brigade came and used their hoses , the water flowed down into the cellars beneath both Mr Sidnell v Wilson's tobacconist's shop at No.lla and also from there into Mr Carver's shop at No.ll. The fire assessors came round.      They went into the cellars and found a lot of water there.      They advised Mr Sidnell v Wilson himself to leave the door open and dry  out the cellar with heaters.    Mr Sidnell v Wilson did so and there has been no trouble in his cellar since.      We do not know whether the fire assessors told the same thing to Mr Carver who was next door in his butcher's shop. But it is said that Mr Carver himself or his successors did not take proper steps to get rid of the damp after this water got in from the hoses.      So much so that it is suggested that the dampness in due course caused dry rot to develop.      Mr Carver himself was only there a further six months when he assigned the lease to Mr Wilson, Mr Arnaudy and Mr Rollingson together. They covenanted to reside personally on the premises and they took over the lease.      Then it appears by the end of 1963 and the beginning of 1964 the landlord, Mr Sidnell v Wilson, discovered that dry rot was rampant in the cellar of No.ll.      He got the surveyors to look at it.      They found that this dry rot was going through the cellar and might indeed spread to Mr Sidnell v Wilson's premises next door.      It has proved so bad that  the floor of the butcher's shop has fallen through.

Under these circumstances, after considerable correspondence,  the landlord's solicitors in October 1964 served notice on the tenants under Section 146 of the Law of Property Act 1925 alleging that there were breaches of covenant to keep in good and tenantable repair.      She landlord required the tenants to dry out the cellar,  replace the rotten timber,  and so forth;  and also to do other repairs such as repairing patches of plaster and ceilings in other parts of the house.

That notice given in October 1964 was not a good notice.       It did not comply with the Leasehold Property  (Repairs) Act as amended by Section 51 of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1954.      That Act was passed shortly before the war because of a great mischief prevalent at that time.      Unscrupulous people used to buy up the reversion of leases:  then bring pressure to bear on the tenants by an exaggerated list of dilapidations. She Act applied to leases for seven years or more which had three years or more to run.      In such cases Parliament enacted that a landlord, when he gives a notice under Section 146 of the Law of Property Act to make good dilapidations, must state on the notice that the tenant is entitled to give a counter-notice.      She effect of a counter-notice is that the landlord cannot proceed to  forfeit the premises or to claim damages unless he has the leave of the Court.      In this case the landlords did not state on the notice of the 9th October 1964 that the tenant had the right to give a counter-notice.      So that notice was invalid.

Nevertheless, after a certain amount of correspondence between solicitors, the landlord's solicitors seem to have realised their mistake.      On the 24th February 1965 they wrote a letter drawing the attention of the tenant to the covenant to keep in good and tenantable repair.      They said it was broken. Then they referred back to the previous notice and told them to carry out the work specified in the previous notice.      They added that the lessee was entitled under the Leasehold Property (Repairs) Act to serve a counter-notice which had to be served within twenty-eight days.      The solicitors for the tenant took advantage of that notice and within twenty-eight days gave a notice claiming the benefit of the Act.      I regard the letter of 24th February 1965 as a fresh notice under Section 146 which contained the requisite statement that the lessee was entitled to give a counter-notice.      Alternatively, any defect was waived by the tenant giving the counter-notice.

Thereupon the landlord applied for leave to bring proceedings in the County Court to forfeit the lease.      In order to get leave,  the landlord had to bring himself within one of the clauses of Section 1(5) of the 1938 Act.      The relevant clauses here are (a) and  (e).      These say that:  "Leave for the purposes of this section shall not be given unless the lessor proves  (a) that the immediate remedying of the breach in question is requisite for preventing substantial diminution in the value of his reversion, or that the value thereof has been substantially diminished by the breach"...or..."(e) special circumstances which in the opinion of the Court render it just and equitable that  leave should be given".

Let me say at once that in the great majority of dilapidation cases when there/want of repair during the term, leave will not be given:  for in most cases the reversion is not diminished much in value by the breach.      But this ease is out of the ordinary.      It is clear that,  if the breach which the landlord alleges is  established, the value of the reversion has been substantially diminished.      Dry rot has invaded the premises.      The floor of the butcher's shop has fallen in. The premises are unusable unless substantial repairs are done. The landlord says it has all come about because the tenants did not dry out the cellar and ventilate it as they ought to have done.      The landlord does, therefore,  "bring himself within Section 1(5)(a) provided always  that he is right in saying that the tenant was in breach.

Now what has the landlord to prove in order to get leave?      Has he actually to prove a breach by the tenant or has he only to show a prima facie case of breach?      Mr Lubbock for the tenant admitted,   as I think quite rightly,  that the landlord need only show a prima facie case of a breach by the tenant. That is all he is required to do.      After  all, the application for leave is only an interlocutory application.      It cannot be supposed that the landlord has to prove his whole case as if it were the trial.      It must be sufficient if he shows a prima facie case,  by which I mean a case which,  if believed, would enable him to succeed.

In this case I fear that the Judge required the landlord to prove more.      He required the landlord to prove that the tenant had been guilty of a breach of covenant.      The Judge was induced to do so I think by the way that counsel on both sides conducted the case.      They called surveyors and so forth as if it were the trial.    Naturally enough the Judge treated it as such.      He said:  "It is for the applicant to show there has been a breach of covenant.      As to the condition of the shop floor, which is the really serious defect in these premises, the applicant has not shown any breach of covenant to repair by the respondents".      Mr Lubbock urged us to treat this statement benevolently.      Even so,  I cannot help thinking that the Judge treated this application almost as the trial of the action by requiring a breach to be proved.      Whereas all the landlord had to show was a prima facie case.

The evidence here for the landlord was in these terms: The landlord's son said there was no trace of dry rot in the cellar in 1962 immediately after the fire.      But by the end of 1965 it was rampaging away.      A surveyor said that it might be due to neglect to dry out the cellar.  On the whole I think this was sufficiently a prima facie case upon which the Judge might give leave.

Mr Lubbock urged that leave should not be given because the dry rot in any case would be damage by fire within the exception.  I can understand that damage caused directly by water from the hoses would be damage by fire, but that is not this case.  The immediate cause of the dry rot was, it is said, leaving the premises damp and not taking proper steps to dry them out, which is a different matter.  In any case that is not a matter which can be decided on an interlocutory application.

I hold, therefore, that the landlord has satisfied Section 5(l)(a) of the Act.  But the Court still has a discretion.  Ought it to exercise it here?  It seems to me that these parties are at such arms length that sooner or later the issues will have to be tried out.  If we did not give leave here, the tenant might bring an action against the landlord for failing to repair the structure: or the landlord might bring an action against the tenants for failing to reside on the premises. In one way or another the issues will have to be decided by the Court.  So we should I think give leave now so that all the issues can be fought out once and for all.

I would allow the appeal accordingly. 

LORD JUSTICE HARMAN: The Leasehold Property (Repairs) Act of 1938 was passed to meet certain abuses to which my Lord has referred.  Like most remedial Acts of that sort, it catches the virtuous in the net which is laid for the sinner.  This is not a case where there has been an abuse of the sort at which the Act was aimed.  The landlord here has been for 25 years the landlord of this property. The grievance which he has got is a real one and not a trumped-up one.  Whether he can succeed or not is a matter, I take it, of very great doubt. But at any rate here is a genuine subject matter for an action and one could have wished that such an action would be one which the landlord could bring as of right;  hut having regard to the Act of 1938 he has got to get the leave of the Court where a counter-notice is  served on him,  as it was here,  by his tenant.

Now having got so far, the learned County Court Judge approached the matter on the footing that it was necessary that it should he proved before him that a breach had occurred. If that be right,  one of the effects of the Act is to make two actions flourish where one flourished before.      Having proved that a breach has occurred for the purpose of getting leave, you have to prove it  all over again for the purpose of the action.      I do not think that can have been meant.      What must have been meant was that the applicant must show a prima facie case and it  is enough if that is what he does.      The learned Judge said:   "I have no confidence whatsoever in the suggestion that the shop floor rot started after the fire or because of the water going into the cellar" - that is to say he was not satisfied that it was so.      He was hot bound to be so  satisfied in the sense that he would have to be satisfied in order  that  the plaintiff should succeed in the action. Shis was a case which was to be  judged as interlocutory applications on motion are judged.        If the applicant shows a case for it, he is prima facie entitled to have his relief. That decides finally nothing between the parties.      But in this Act under sub-section (5) there  are also the following words: "Special circumstances which in the opinion of the Court render it  just and equitable that leave should be given". It seems to me if ever there was a case where special circumstances  exist,  it is this one.      It is a complicated case. There are points which bristle in every direction.      It is most desirable that these points should now be tried.        The issue should be  joined which in the end comes to this:    who should rebuild the lower part of this structure,  and that is no doubt a substantial and expensive matter.      Both parties need to have it tried sooner or later.      I do think there are special circumstances as mentioned in sub-section (5),  and on that ground  alone it is  a case in which leave ought to be given. I should be prepared to grant leave on that ground alone but I do not dissent from what my Lord has said under  (a). I would allow the appeal. 

LORD JUSTICE DIPLOCK:    I agree, though with some hesitation, that the appeal  should be allowed.      I think the letter of the 24th February 1965 may properly be read in conjunction with the earlier notice of the 9th October 1964 and those two documents together constitute a notice specifying the requirements of sub-section (4) of Section 1 of the Act.      The point which has caused me some hesitation is whether or not it has been established by the tenant that the learned Judge applied the wrong criteria in determining whether or not to give leave under sub-section (5) of Section 1 of the Act to the landlord to bring his proceedings for forfeiture.      Parliament cannot have intended by its provisions for application for leave in sub-section (5) that there should be two trials of the matter.       It must I think follow, therefore,  that when in sub-section (5) it is said that "leave for the purposes of this section shall not be given unless the lessor proves", and then (a) to  (e),  that that cannot require a standard of proof of the same character as that which is required in the trial of an action.      I agree with my brethren that he must be satisfied that there is material on which, if it were accepted as accurate, an arguable case can be put forward that the conditions  set  out in the sub-section are fulfilled.      I use the expression "arguable case" rather than the expression "prima facie case" because the difficulty of the latter expression seems to me to be that it invites an enquiry at the hearing of the application itself into evidence contradicting what  in the first  instance is a prima facie case and therefore would lead to a complete trial of the action or is capable of leading to a complete trial of the action on the application for leave.  I think it is sufficient that the lessor should show that there is a bona fide arguable case that the conditions or one or other of them set out in the paragraphs of the sub-section are fulfilled, and that if he does that, it is no function of the County Court Judge on the application for leave to go into the merits of the matter and hear rebutting evidence as if the trial were taking place then. The hearing of the application is not the occasion for resolving conflicts of evidence, for non constat that the resolution would be the same in the light of further evidence which each party would be entitled to call at the trial itself.  If, as happened in this case, the parties do choose to treat the application for leave as if it were the trial, which is what they appear to have done, and the evidence called then does convince the County Court Judge that there was no breach committed by the tenant and that no other evidence which could be proffered at the trial could alter this conclusion, then I certainly should not interfere with the decision of the County Court Judge.  But I think on reading his written judgment that that was not his approach - that he was looking at the matter, as indeed he was induced to look at the matter by the conduct of the parties themselves, as if he had to be satisfied that the landlord had proved a breach on the balance of the evidence called before him by both sides on the occasion of the application.

That was not his function on the application.  I think he, very excusably, misdirected himself in law and I would allow the appeal on that ground.

Order: Appeal allowed.  Costs   below to be costs in the forthcoming action.  Costs of appeal to be respondents' costs in cause.

JUDGMENT
(on appeal as to liability)
(without calling upon Counsel for the Appellant to reply)

THE MASTER OP THE ROLLS:   On the 13th June, 1962, a group of children were crossing the New Kings Road.  They were Malcolm Gough, who was 17; his brother John, of 10; and his sister Elizabeth, who was 13Â½.  They were coming from the Wandsworth Bridge Road, crossing the Hew Kings Road, and going to a swimming pool on the other side.  They waited on the pavement for some little time to see if it was safe to cross.  Then a lorry came up, coming up the Wandsworth Bridge Road and turning into the New Kings Road.  The lorry driver had got pretty well halfway across the road, towards the bollards, and he stopped at about 5 feet from the bollards.  He put his right hand out to warn the traffic which was coming up the road.  He saw the children waiting; he beckoned to them to cross; and they did. They had got across just beyond the lorry when a "bubble" car, driven by the defendant, came through the gap between the front of the lorry and the bollard, about 5 feet, just missed the eldest boy, and struck the young boy of 11, but ran into and seriously injured Elizabeth, of 13Â½.  Now, on Elizabeth's behalf, there is a claim against the driver of the "bubble" car for negligence.

The judge has found that the driver was negligent.  He said that the "bubble" car was going too fast in the circumstances, and that he did not keep a proper look-out because he ought to have seen the lorry driver's signal and he did not see it.  He has found, therefore, that the driver of the "bubble" car was to blame and negligent.

But then there came the question whether the little girl, Elizabeth, was herself guilty of contributory negligence.  As to that, the judge found that she was one-third to blame for this accident.   I will read what the judge said about it.   "Was there contributory negligence?", he asked.  He answered:  "I think that there was.  I think that the plaintiff was careless in advancing past the lorry into the open road without pausing to see whether there was any traffic coming from her right.  I do not think that her responsibility was very great.  After all, the lorry driver had beckoned her on.  She might have thought it unlikely that any traffic would try to come through the gap. She might have thought that if there were any traffic coming from that direction, it would wait until the lorry started to move or gave the all clear.  She was, after all, only 13 years old.  I assess her degree of responsibility at one-third".

I am afraid I cannot agree with the judge.  A very young child cannot be guilty of contributory negligence.  An older child may be.  But it depends on the circumstances.  A judge should only find a child guilty of contributory negligence if he or she is of such an age as to be expected to take precautions for his or her own safety: and then he or she is only to be found guilty if blame should be attached to him or her.  A child has not the road sense or the experience of his or her elders. He or she is not to be found guilty unless he or she is blameworthy.

In this particular case I have no doubt that there was no blameworthiness to be attributed to Elizabeth at all. Here she was with her elder brother crossing a road.  They had been beckoned on by the lorry driver.  What more could you expect the child to do than to cross in pursuance of the beckoning?  It is said by the judge that she ought to have leant forward and looked to see whether anything was coming.  That indeed might be reasonably expected of a grown-up person with a fully developed road sense, but not of a child of 13Â½.

I am clearly of opinion that the judge was wrong in attributing any contributory negligence to Elizabeth, aged 13Â½; and I would allow the appeal accordingly. 

LORD JUSTICE DANCKWERTS:   I agree.

This seems to me a very bad case of negligence on the part of the driver of the "bubble" car.   It is the kind of accident which occurs so easily when one driver pulls up courteously to let some pedestrian cross the road and another, selfish, driver comes thrusting past and causes an accident by so doing.  The speed at which the defendant was proceeding was so great that he did not see the lorry driver's hand outstretched, and the unfortunate Elizabeth appeared merely as a "white blur" when he hit her.  The facts seem to me to speak for themselves.  The accident was wholly caused, in my opinion, by the carelessness of the defendant and the speed at which he was travelling.

As regards the point about contributory negligence on the part of Elizabeth, I agree with every word which the Master of the Rolls has said and I need not add anything, I think, in that respect.

I also agree that the appeal should be allowed. 

LORD JUSTICE SALMON:   I entirely agree.

This girl of 13Â½ was waiting perfectly properly on the pavement with her two brothers to cross the New Kings Road.  The lorry, which had pulled out of Wandsworth Bridge Road, stopped in the New Kings Road to allow the children to cross.  Its offside front wheel was about 5 feet from the bollard in the middle of the road.  The driver held up his right arm to warn traffic coming from the east along New Kings Road to stop, and with his left arm he beckoned the group over.  They crossed.  The defendant's motor car, at what the judge has held to be an excessive speed, ignored the signal to stop, went straight through the gap between the lorry and the bollard, and knocked the plaintiff over and injured her quite seriously.

I think that this question as to whether the plaintiff can be said to have been guilty of contributory negligence depends on whether any ordinary child of 13Â½ could be expected to have done any more than this child did.   I say, "any ordinary child".1 I do not mean a paragon of prudence; nor do I mean a scatterbrained child; but the ordinary girl of 13Â½.  I think that if any ordinary child of 13Â½, seeing a lorry stop to let her over and a lorry driver, a grown-up person in whom she no doubt has some confidence, beckoning her to cross the road, goes straight on, no one could be surprised.  I agree that if she had been a good deal older and hardened by experience and perhaps consequently with less confidence in adults, she might have said to herself:  "I wonder if that man has given the proper signal to traffic coming up?  I wonder if that traffic has heeded it?  I wonder if he ought to have beckoned me across when he did, whether he looked behind him before doing so?".  She would not have gone past the front of the lorry without verifying for herself that it was safe to do so.  But I think it would be quite wrong to hold that a child of 13Â½ is negligent because she fails to go through those mental processes and relies unquestioningly on the lorry driver's signal.

The finding of contributory negligence cannot be supported, and I would agree, therefore, that the appeal should be allowed.

JUDGMENT (on appeal  as  to quantum)

THE MASTER OP THE ROLLS:  Miss Elizabeth Gough is now 17i years of age.  Pour years ago, on the 13th June, 1962, in an accident which we dealt with this morning, she was injured, and the question is what the damages should be.   Her right leg was broken, both the tibia and the fibula bones.  She was in hospital for some weeks.   She was discharged after seven or eight weeks in hospital.  Then the plaster was removed, and there was other physiotherapy.  She was eventually discharged as an out-patient in October of that year.  She went back to school, I think, on the 1st October, and has been at school since.   I expect she has left school now.  The result of it is that the right leg, so far as the bones are concerned, is well healed.   She had a broken collar-bone:  that was soon healed. She also had, and has, a scar on her right elbow.

If the matter had stopped there it would not be regarded, in these Courts at least, as a very serious accident.   Indeed when she was seen in December of 1962 by an eminent surgeon, Mr. Hume Kendall, he said that the fracture had united firmly but that there was a slight outward bowing (which we have seen in the Court), and there was a lÂ¼ - inch shortening of the leg.  "She has recovered full movements of the knee and ankle.  As time goes on she will continue to improve, the shortening will be made up and the tibia will gradually straighten.  In the meantime she should become symptom-free within the next three months".  So there within nine months of the accident the surgeon thought she would be quite all right.  But it has not turned out like that.  That was too optimistic a report.  In order to correct this shortening of the leg, she ought to have a different shoe, to have a raised shoe which would raise her foot by half an inch, or thereabouts, so that she could walk evenly. She was not told to have this raised shoe.  She did not have it before the trial.  She has gone on (as the doctor says) compensating for this shortening of the limb by tilting her pelvis - that is, her hip "bone, so that it protrudes a little.  She has gone on for these last three or four years like that, walking along with this tilting pelvis; and she has no doubt suffered pain.  She is not able to dance as she would like to do. She has tried to swim, but her legs ache after swimming. Indeed she is embarrassed by it when she meets people and in situations of that kind.  She says, and has told the doctors, that the pain has been getting worse, not only at the site of the break but gradually extending down the leg:  it is still bad,

What is the cause of that pain?  Her own general practitioner and another doctor, Dr. Cramer, from Bromley, said that they thought it was organic, something to do with the accident itself; whereas Mr. Hume Kendall, the eminent surgeon, said he could not find any cause for it, it was what is called functional.  She is not making it up:  she has a real pain: but when she gets over the tension and the anxiety of her case at law it will get better.  Whatever the precise cause of it, there is no doubt that she has had the pain up to date.  But there is equally no doubt (and I am sure it is the best possible advice, and her mother has been helping her with regard to it) that she ought to be wearing different shoes.  She has made a good effort, apparently, since the trial.  She may find it a bit awkward now, and it feels different; but it is most satisfactory that, with her mother's encouragement and help, she is making a really good effort to wear better shoes, which should correct the whole trouble.

Mr. Hume Kendall was asked:  "With a raised heel, a raise of half an inch to three-quarters of an inch, can you see any reason why this girl should not live a normal pain-free life for the rest of her life?".  He said:  "No, I see no reason why she should not".  So that although it may take a little time before she gets over it all, the pain may get better and in all probability should get better.

Now, such being the injuries, what are the damages?  The judge assessed damages for her at the sum of Â£2,750 general damages plus Â£12 special damage.  We have had put before us all the medical evidence.   We have had read to us the judge's reasoning.   It seems to me that the learned judge was much too pessimistic about Miss Gough's future.  He spoke in this way: "She may have to wear a surgical boot to correct the shortening of the leg".  I do not think that any of the doctors really went as far as that.   They all, when they were taxed with it, suggested a raised shoe.  The learned judge said:  "She may get away with a much thickened shoe sole".  I think that it is reasonably certain that with the new shoe she will be able to walk evenly without any tilting of the pelvis.  Then he said: "The pains will possibly go but if she continues to tilt her pelvis, it is likely that severe backache will supervene".  The backache should go as soon as she has the raised shoe and gets used to wearing it.

It seems to me that the judge took far too pessimistic a view of this matter.  Indeed, I am afraid that, comparing this award with other awards to which we are used in this Court, this is really an award for a broken leg which has been well mended, and all that is left is a lÂ¼ -inch shortening.  Even the effects of that shortening can be made good quite a lot by a raised shoe, without any permanent ill-effects.  I realise, of course, that as a girl she would like to wear, like other girls, just ordinary normal shoes, and it is a drawback for her to have to wear a special shoe, but not all that much.

I think that this award was erroneous - so erroneous that this Court should interfere; and I would reduce it to the sum of Â£1,500 general damages.  I would allow the appeal accordingly. 

LORD JUSTICE DANCKWERTS:   I agree.

It seems to me too that the amount of the damages awarded is so excessive and so much above the proper amount that we ought to interfere.   I agree with the figure of Â£1,500 proposed by the Master of the Rolls. 

LORD JUSTICE SALMON:   I agree.

I think there may be a tendency for awards to be somewhat too little for really serious injuries and too much for less serious injuries.  This case, I am confident, can be classified as a case of a less serious injury.  I appreciate that this girl has suffered a good deal of pain and inconvenience and embarrassment during the last four years, having had a comminuted compound fracture of her right leg.  But after all is said and done, this remains the case of a broken leg with the only permanent results being a very slight bowing of the leg (which we have seen) and with an inch and a quarter shortening of the leg.  A half-inch, everyone agrees, is something which is quite common without any accident and causes no inconvenience at all.  There was some doubt as to whether the pain arose from organic or functional causes.  I agree with Mr. Pain that it does not matter much which, because Mr. Cramer, who said he thought it was organic, although he was quite unable to explain how the organic cause produced this effect, said that he hoped and believed the pain would clear up; and Mr. Hume Kendall was even more confident that it would go in time.  There is no doubt that if this girl wears, as she is now beginning to wear under her mother's persuasion, shoes either with a built-up sole or perhaps an adjustment of ordinary shoes, an adjustment of the heel, the shortening of the leg can be and will be corrected.  Once that goes, the strong probability is that within a very short time she will for all practical purposes be as good as she was before the accident, and the pain will disappear.

I think that, on any view, when one considers the awards made in these Courts in other cases, an award of Â£2,750 is indefensible, in spite of the gallant and persuasive attempt of Mr. Pain to defend it.  I agree that the damages ought to be reduced to Â£1,500.

(Plaintiff's appeal on liability allowed with costs. Defendant's appeal on quantum allowed, with half his costs of the appeal. Award of general damages reduced to Â£1,500.  Taxation of Plaintiff's costs in both appeals under Legal Aid and Advice Act.  Total award of damages, Â£1,512, to be paid into West London County Court)

THE MASTER OP THE ROLLS:    Mr  Lavarack is a very able man of business. He is now only 51, but he has achieved phenomenal success.       In 1954 he was employed by Woods of Colchester as their European representative.       His headquarters were in Paris.       He  expanded  their European business  greatly and formed a French subsidiary called Compagnie Francaise Woods,  of which he became the head.      Prom 1954 to  1961  he was  paid  a retaining fee and  a commission on sales. His earnings increased apace,  so much so that in the year 1960/61 he received a retaining fee of Â£1,000 and commission of Â£5,800, making Â£6,800 or thereabouts.       Then the Company changed the system.       They instituted a bonus  scheme for  their employees.    Each employee was paid a salary and allocated so many points,   according to his position,   entitling him to  participate in the scheme. Mr Lavarack was allocated 5,600 points.      The result was that in 1961/62 Mr Lavarack was paid a salary of Â£4,000 and a bonus  of Â£3,500, making Â£7,500 or  thereabouts.

In 1962 the Company asked Mr Lavarack to  enter into  a service agreement.      He did so.       It was for five years  and was again on the basis  of  a salary of Â£4,000 a year and  a bonus.    It was  embodied in writing and  contained the following terms:-"1. Mr Lavarack shall be  employed by the Company in the capacity of European Sales Manager     .... 2. Mr Lavarack's  employment hereunder shall be deemed to take effect as from the 1st April,   1962,   and continue until determined by six months'  notice in writing given by either party to the other,   expiring on or  at any time  after 31st March,  1967...
 
4..  The Company shall,  during the continuance of his  employment hereunder,   pay Mr Lavarack as remuneration for  his services  a salary at the rate of not less than Â£4,000 per annum payable monthly on the last day of each month  and  such bonus   (if any) as the directors of the Company shall from time to time determine.

9. Mr Lavarack shall not during the continuance of his  employment hereunder be engaged or interested (save as the holder of shares or securities of a Company quoted or dealt in on a recognised Stock Exchange in the United Kingdom or elsewhere) either directly or indirectly in any concerns other than that of the Company save with the written consent of the Company". By correspondence the Company gave its written consent to Mr Lavarack being a director of a French Company called Martin-dale Electrique and acquiring 25 per cent. of the ordinary share capital of that Company.

Thenceforward for over two years Mr Lavarack served Woods of Colchester and its French subsidiary, Compagnie Francaise Woods.  He received these sums for his work:-

Unfortunately differences arose and on 27th July, 1964, the Company dismissed Mr Lavarack at a moment's notice, sayings "This letter is to give you formal notice of termination of your service agreement dated 18th July, 1962, with effect from today". Inasmuch as the agreement had still two years and eight months to run, Mr Lavarack was clearly entitled to compensation.  On 9th November, 1964, he issued a writ claiming damages for wrongful dismissal.  He took out a summons under Order XIV.  The Company charged him with fraud.  The charge was baseless.  So baseless, indeed, that it did not give rise even to an issue fit to be tried.  On 28th April, 1964, Mr Lavarack obtained judgment for damages to be assessed.  In December 1965 Master Jacob sat to make the assessment.  He assessed the damages at Â£2,945.  Mr Lavarack says this is too small.  The Company cross appeal saying it is too large.

In assessing damages for wrongful dismissal, the Court, as I understand, it,  has to make two calculations:  First,  the Court has to  consider what  the position would have "been if his old employment had run its full course.       It must  calculate the sums which he might reasonably have expected to receive in bis old employment.       Secondly,  the Court has to consider what the plaintiff has done since his dismissal.       It is  his duty to act reasonably in mitigation of damages.       If he has acted reasonably and obtained new employment,  the Court must  calculate the sums which he has received for his work in his new employment during the run-off period.       If he has not   acted reasonably,   the Court must calculate the  sums which he might  reasonably have been expected to receive if he had acted reasonably.      The damages then are assessed by giving him the sum    which he would have received in his  old employment,  less  the sum to be deducted  in mitigation of damage. 

1. THE EARNINGS IF HIS  OLD EMPLOYMENT HAD CONTINUED

There are three items under this head.      Two were beyond dispute. 

Item 1:

If his  employment had continued,  Mr Lavarack would have received a salary at Â£4,000 a year from the date of dismissal, 27th July,  1964,  to the end of the term,   31st March,  1967
Â£10,710.    12s.     5d. 
Item 2:
A bonus for the year 1964/5 which was  declared at a Board Meeting on 22nd May,   1964  (before his dismissal)
Â£2,613        2s.       0d.

Item 3 is disputed.  It concerns the future bonuses for the years 1965/1966 and 1966/1967.  Is the plaintiff entitled to compensation for loss of these bonuses or their equivalent? The plaintiff had no legal right to receive a bonus every year. It was entirely in the discretion of the directors.  Hence it was suggested to us that he was not entitled to receive compensation for loss of future bonuses.  I cannot accept this contention.

When a servant is wrongfully dismissed from his  employment,   he is entitled to  compensation for the full amount  of all the emoluments and allowances which  he would have earned but for the breach of contract,   see Addis v.  Gramophone Co.,  1909 Appeal Cases,   p.488, at p.504:   and this  includes not  only salary and  commission to which he  is entitled by law,  but also bonuses which he might reasonably expect to receive from his  employer.      For the simple reason that by the wrongful dismissal,  the employer has deprived him of  the chance of receiving such bonuses;   and  he  is  entitled to compensation for  the loss of the chance,  even though he had no legal right to receive them,   see Richardson v. Mellish  (1824)  2 Bingham,  p.229,   at p.239 by Chief Justice Bests   Inchbald v. Western Neilgherev Coffee Co.   (1864)  17 Common Bench New Series at p.740 by Chief Justice Erle,  at p.743 by Mr Justice Keating: Chaplin v. Hicks,  1911,  2  King's Bench,   p.786.      This loss of a chance is a regular head of compensation.       Thus,  a hairdresser's assistants  who is wrongfully dismissed,  is   entitled to compensation for  the loss of the chance of earning tips,  even though he has no legal right  to them,  see Manubene v. Leon,   1919,  1 King's Bench, p.208.       Likewise, when a man had  a good chance of receiving a pension under a contributory pension scheme,  he was entitled to compensation for the loss of it,   even though the employer had a right to discontinue the scheme,   see Bold v. Brough Nicholson & Hall 1964,   1 Weekly Law Reports,   p.201 at  p.211.

An attempt was made before us to bring this case within the rule that  "where there are several ways  in which a contract may be  performed,   that mode is  adopted which is the  least  profitable to the  plaintiff,   and the least burdensome  to the defendant", see Cockburn v.  Alexander,   6 Common Bench,  p.791 at p.814 by Mr Justice Maule.       But  that  has no application here.       There were not two ways  in which this  contract could be performed.       There was only one way,  namely,  by the plaintiff performing his  service and the defendants paying him for  it.      In such a case the compensation is to be based on the probabilities of the case - on the remuneration which the plaintiff might reasonably be expected to receive - and not  on the bare minimum necessary to  satisfy the legal right,  see Abrahams v. Reiach,   1922,  1 King's Bench, p.477; Withers v.  General Theatre Corporation,  1933,   2 King's Bench,   p.536.

I am prepared to hold,  therefore,  that if the bonus scheme had been continued,   the  plaintiff would have been entitled to compensation for  loss of future bonuses.       But  a further point arises.      We know that in fact the bonus scheme was discontinued in the  year after Mr Lavarack left.       In 1965 a new managing director was appointed.      He rearranged the basis of remuneration of the   employees.       Instead of their receiving a salary and  a bonus  (based on a bonus scheme) he replaced it with a fixed salary and no bonus.      Most  of the  employees got an increase in salary and no bonus.       (Two at the very top got a decrease in salary and no bonus,  but we do not know why).       But,  so far  as Mr Lavarack is concerned,  if he had not been dismissed,  his salary would have been increased for  the rest of his term.       In lieu of a bonus,  his salary would have been increased by Â£1,000 a year. The Master's finding was clear and  cannot be disputed;   "If the service agreement had not been terminated and the plaintiff had continued  in the  employment   of the defendants,   his  salary for   the years 1965/66  and 1966/67 would have been increased by the annual sum of Â£1,000 and that,   therefore,   he has lost the sum of Â£2,000 by way of increased salary which he would otherwise have received". Accordingly,   the Master  held that there should be added: 

Item 3:

Expected  increase in salary   (in lieu of  bonus) of Â£1,000 a year for  the years 1965/66 and 1966/67    Â£2,000.0s.0d

It is said,  however,  that once the bonus scheme was  discontinued,   the plaintiff lost  any right  to  compensation for  loss of future bonuses.       I cannot see this.       If the defendants,  after   he left,  had discontinued their business  altogether,   or  transferred it to someone else, he would not thereby be deprived  of his compensation, see Turner v. Goldsmith, 1891, 1 Queen's Bench, p.544: Brace v. Calder, 1895, 2 Queen's Bench, p.253. Nor should he  be deprived of it "because, after he left, they discontinued the bonus scheme and replaced it by a scheme for increase in salary.  The defendants, by wrongfully dismissing him, have deprived him of the chance of getting either future bonuses or their equivalent - an increase of salary in lieu of bonus: and he is entitled to compensation for loss of the chance.  The value of the chance was in this case considerable.  The Master was satisfied that, if he had not been dismissed, he would have got Â£2,000 by way of increase of salary.  So he has lost this sum. I think he should be allowed it under Item 3. 

2. THE EARNINGS IN HIS NEW EMPLOYMENT

Immediately after his dismissal in July 1964 Mr Lavarack took up employment with a French Company called Martindale Electrique (which I will call Martindale),   It was not in competition with Woods.  But it was in a bad way.  It had lost about Â£9,000, and had resources left of only Â£3,000,  Mr Lavarack bought half the shares for Â£1,500 and became manager at a. salary of Â£1,500 a year.

In addition, Mr Lavarack took a financial interest in a new Company called Compagnie Francaise de Ventilation (which I will call Ventilation).  This Company was highly competitive with Woods,  Mr Lavarack would not, if his employment had continued, have been able to take a financial interest in it.  Ventilation was formed by a former colleague, Monsieur Devaud, who also left Woods about the same time as Mr Lavarack,  But Mr Lavarack did not work for this Company.  He put money into it.  He invested Â£14,000 in it.

The Master held that Mr Lavarack acted reasonably and properly in taking up employment with Martindale: and no doubt in making the investments.  He held that Mr Lavarack must give credit for his drawings from Martindale, actual and prospective, for his work for them.  These sums came to Â£3,717.9s.2d. for the period from August 1964 to March 1967.  That item is not in dispute.

But a serious question arises as to Mir Lavarack's investments in Martindale and Ventilation.  Ought he to give credit for his profits from them?

[
THE MASTER OP THE ROLLS:    Mr  Lavarack is a very able man of business. He is now only 51, but he has achieved phenomenal success.       In 1954 he was employed by Woods of Colchester as their European representative.       His headquarters were in Paris.       He  expanded  their European business  greatly and formed a French subsidiary called Compagnie Francaise Woods,  of which he became the head.      Prom 1954 to  1961  he was  paid  a retaining fee and  a commission on sales. His earnings increased apace,  so much so that in the year 1960/61 he received a retaining fee of Â£1,000 and commission of Â£5,800, making Â£6,800 or thereabouts.       Then the Company changed the system.       They instituted a bonus  scheme for  their employees.    Each employee was paid a salary and allocated so many points,   according to his position,   entitling him to  participate in the scheme. Mr Lavarack was allocated 5,600 points.      The result was that in 1961/62 Mr Lavarack was paid a salary of Â£4,000 and a bonus  of Â£3,500, making Â£7,500 or  thereabouts.

In 1962 the Company asked Mr Lavarack to  enter into  a service agreement.      He did so.       It was for five years  and was again on the basis  of  a salary of Â£4,000 a year and  a bonus.    It was  embodied in writing and  contained the following terms:-"1. Mr Lavarack shall be  employed by the Company in the capacity of European Sales Manager     .... 2. Mr Lavarack's  employment hereunder shall be deemed to take effect as from the 1st April,   1962,   and continue until determined by six months'  notice in writing given by either party to the other,   expiring on or  at any time  after 31st March,  1967...
 
4..  The Company shall,  during the continuance of his  employment hereunder,   pay Mr Lavarack as remuneration for  his services  a salary at the rate of not less than Â£4,000 per annum payable monthly on the last day of each month  and  such bonus   (if any) as the directors of the Company shall from time to time determine. 

 ....

9. Mr Lavarack shall not during the continuance of his  employment hereunder be engaged or interested (save as the holder of shares or securities of a Company quoted or dealt in on a recognised Stock Exchange in the United Kingdom or elsewhere) either directly or indirectly in any concerns other than that of the Company save with the written consent of the Company". By correspondence the Company gave its written consent to Mr Lavarack being a director of a French Company called Martin-dale Electrique and acquiring 25 per cent. of the ordinary share capital of that Company.

Thenceforward for over two years Mr Lavarack served Woods of Colchester and its French subsidiary, Compagnie Francaise Woods.  He received these sums for his work:-

[

THE MASTER OF THE ROLLS: (read by LORD JUSTICE WINN): During the War the City of Norwich was bombed by the enemy.  Three houses in Earlham Road were demolished and their sites left vacant.  In May 1949 Mr High bought the site of 77, Earlham Road and started to build a house on it.  He was a builder and he intended to live in it himself.  About the same time Mr Westgate bought the adjoining sites of 73 and 75 Earlham Road and started to build a block of flats on the double site.  In the course of the work Mr Westgate encroached on to Mr High's site.  Mr Westgate dug down nine feet to lay the foundations of the block of flats and he put the footings and foundations twelve inches over the boundary into Mr High's land.  Above ground level, the wall of the block of flats was to be on the boundary line, but below ground level, the foundations trespassed a good twelve inches over the boundary.

Mr High at once objected to the trespass.  On the 2nd November, 1949, there was a meeting on the site between Mr High and Mr Westgate, a surveyor, an architect and others. Mr Westgate admitted the trespass.  Mr High could have compelled Mr Westgate to remove the foundations.  But instead of doing so, Mr High came to this agreement with Mr Westgate:

On the one hand, Mr Westgate was to be at liberty to keep the foundations of the block of flats as they ware in Mr High's land; and Mr Westgate was to build up the wall of the flats on that side with no windows or openings on to Mr High's land.

On the other hand, Mr High was to have a right of way from the back of his own house (then being built) across the yard of Mr Westgate's block of flats so as to give access to a side road, Belvoir Street.  (At that time, in November 1949, Mr High had not got a oar, but he hoped to get one some day and desired access for it).

After the agreement was made, letters passed evidencing it.  There was a suggestion that the solicitors should be instructed to draw up a written agreement, but it was never done. On this account it was suggested before us that there was no concluded agreement.  But the Judge was satisfied there was.

So am I.  The agreement was complete.  All that was suggested was to put it into form.

Both sides acted on the agreement.  Mr Westgate went on building his block of flats with the foundations encroaching into Mr High's land, and no windows or openings on that side. Mr High built his house in such a way that the only practicable access by car was across the yard at the back of Mr Westgate's block of flats.

In March 1950 Mr Westgate sold his site to Mr and Mrs Wright.  The conveyance made no mention of the foundations or of the right of way for Mr High.  But the Judge inferred that the Wrights were told about the agreement.  Soon afterwards Mr High finished his house. The block of flats ware finished. Mr High used the way across the yard.

In 1959 Mr High built a garage at the back of his house, No.77.  In doing so he relied on the right of way given him in 1949.  He so constructed his garage that it could only be entered from the yard of the Wrights' block of flats and the ear could only be driven in and out over that yard.  The Wrights 'watched the garage being built and complimented Mr High on it. Next year Mr High bought a car and thereafter continually garaged it in his garage and went in and out across the Wrights' yard - which was the only means of access.

In the next year, 1960, the Wrights got Mr High to resurface the yard.  The cost was Â£14.10a.0d.  The Wrights had four garages for their flats.  Mr High had his one.  Mr High paid one-fifth of the coat.  Thus the Wrights recognised that he used the yard to get to and from his garage.

On the 27th November, 1962, the Wrights put up the block of flats for sale by auction.  The particulars of sale stated distinctly that there was a right of way for Mr High, saying: 

"The property is also sold subject to the right of the owners and occupiers of No.77 Earlham Road as now enjoyed to pass and repass with or without vehicles over the open yard to and from Belvoir Street".

At the auction the property was sold to E.R.Ives Investments Ltd. During the investigation of title the purchasers' solicitors asked: "How did the right of way over the yard in favour of No.77 Earlham Road arise?".  The vendors' solicitors replied: "We imagine that this arose as a result of the destruction of No.73 and No.75 during the War.  Presumably No.77 was given a right of way over the yard in lieu of over the 4 ft. wide passageway, but we cannot trace any document in connection therewith".

On the 1st January, 1963, the conveyance was made by the Wrights to E.R.Ives Investments Ltd.  It expressly stated that the property was conveyed subject "to the right (if any) of the owners and occupiers of No.77 Earlham Road as now enjoyed to pass and repass with or without vehicles over the open yard at the rear of the block of flats to and from Belvoir Street".

Now here is the point.  The right of way was never registered as a land charge.  The purchasers, E.R.Ives Investments Ltd., say that it should have been registered under Class C (iv) as an Estate Contract, or under Class D (iii) as an Equitable Easement: and that, as it was not registered, it is void against them, the purchasers.  Even though they had the most explicit notice of it, nevertheless they say it is void against them.  They claim to be entitled to prevent Mr High having any access to his garage across their yard: and thus render it useless to him.  They have brought an action for an injunction to stop him crossing the yard at all.

One thing is quite clear.  Apart from this point about the Land Charges Act, 1925, Mr High would have in equity a good right of way across the yard.  This right arises in two ways:-

1. Mutual benefit and burden.
The right arises out of the agreement of the 2nd November, 1949, and the subsequent action taken on it: on the principle that "he who takes the benefit must accept the burden".  When adjoining owners of land make an agreement to secure continuing rights and benefits for each of them in or over the land of the other, neither of them can take the benefit of the agreement and throw over the burden of it.  This applies not only to the original parties, but also to their successors.  The successor who takes the continuing benefit must take it subject to the continuing burden.  This principle has been applied to neighbours who send their water into a common drainage system, see Hopgood v. Brown, 1955, 1 Weekly Law Reports, page 213: and to purchasers of houses on a building estate who had the benefit of using the roads and were subject to the burden of contributing to the upkeep, see Halsall v. Brizell 1957 Chancery, page 169.  The principle clearly applies in the present case.  The owners of the block of flats have the benefit of having their foundations in Mr High's land.  So long as they take that benefit, they must shoulder the burden.  They must observe the condition on which the benefit was granted, namely, they must allow Mr High and his successors to have access over their yard, of. May v. Belleville. 1905, 2 Chancery, page 605.  Conversely, so long as Mr High takes the benefit of the access, he must permit the block of flats to keep their foundations in his land. 

2. Equity arising out of acquiescence: 
The right arises out of the expense incurred by Mr High in building his garage, as it is now, with access only over the yard: and the Wrights standing by and acquiescing in it, knowing that he believed he had a right of way over the yard.  By so doing the Wrights created in Mr High's mind a reasonable expectation that his access over the yard would not be disturbed.  That gives rise to an "equity arising out acquiescence".  It is available not only against the Wrights but also their successors in title.  The Court will not allow that expectation to be defeated when it would be inequitable so to do.  It is for the Court in each case to decide in what way the equity can be satisfied, see Inwards v. Baker, 1965, 2 Queen's Bench, page 29: Ward v. Kirkland, 1966, 1 Weekly Law Reports, page 621, and the cases cited therein.  In this case it could only be satisfied by allowing Mr High and his successors to have access over the yard so long as the block of flats has its foundations in his land.

The next question is this: Was that right a land charge such as to need registration under the Land Charges Act, 1925? For if it was a land charge, it was never registered and would be void as against any purchaser, see Section 13 of the Act. It would, therefore, be void against ER Ives Investments Ltd v JW High, even though they took with the most express knowledge and notice of the right.

It was suggested that the agreement of the 2nd November, 1949, was "an estate contract" within Class C(iv).  I do not think so.  There was no contract by Mr Westgate to convey a legal estate of any kind.

It was next suggested that the right was an "equitable easement" within Class D (iii).  This class is defined as "any easement right or privilege over or affecting land created or arising after the commencement of this Act, and being merely an. equitable interest".  Those words are almost identical with Section 2(3)(iii)of the Law of Property Act, 1925, and should be given the same meaning.  They must be read in conjunction with Sections 1(2)(a), 1(3) and 4(1) of the Law of Property Act, 1925.  It then appears that an "equitable easement" is a proprietary interest in land such as would before 1926 have been recognised as capable of being conveyed or created at law, but which since 1926 only takes effect as an equitable interest. An instance of such a proprietary interest is a profit a'prendre for life. It does not include a right to possession by a requisitioning authority, see Lewisham Borough Council v. Maloney. 1948, 1 King's Bench, page 50.  Nor does it include a right, liberty or privilege arising in equity by reason of "mutual benefit and burden", or arising out of "acquiescence", or by reason of a contractual licence: because none of those before 1926 were proprietary interests such as were capable of being conveyed or created at law.  They only subsisted in equity. They do not need to be registered as land charges, so as to bind successors, but take effect in equity without registration, see an article by Mr C.V.Davidge on "Equitable Easements" in (1937) 59 Law Quarterly Review, page 259, and by Professor H.W.R. Wade in 1956 Cambridge Law Journal, pages 225-6.

The right of Mr High to cross this yard was not a right such as could ever have been created or conveyed at law. It subsisted only in equity.  It therefore still subsists in equity without being registered.  Any other view would enable the owners of the flats to perpetrate the grossest injustice. They could block up Mr High's access to the garage, whilst keeping their foundations in his land.  That cannot be right.

I am confirmed in this construction of the statute when I remember that there are many houses adjoining one another which have drainage systems in common, with mutual benefits and burdens.  The statute cannot have required all these to be registered as land charges.

I know that this greatly restricts the scope of Class D(iii) but this is not disturbing. A Special Committee has already suggested that Class D(iii) should be abolished altogether, see the Report of the Committee on Land Charges (1956) Command Paper 9825, paragraph 16.

In these circumstances it is not necessary to consider the counterclaim. I would only say that I do not think the owners of the block of flats have acquired a "squatter's title" to the space occupied by the foundations. They ware only licensees and cannot acquire a title by limitation. If they were entitled to block up Mr High's access over their yard, he would I think be entitled to require them to remove the foundations from his land. But, fortunately for them, no such consequence will befall them. They can keep their foundations there, but they must not block up or impede his access across their yard, with or without vehicles.

I would therefore dismiss the appeal.

LORD JUSTICE DANCKWERTS: This appeal from the decision of His  Honour Judge Carey Evans is concerned with property built on a  site made vacant by war damage fronting on Earlham Road and Belvoir Street, Norwich.  The respondent, Mr High, owned the site  of No.77, Earlham Road and Mr Westgate owned the sites of Nos.  73 and 75, Earlham Road.  They were both builders.  Mr Westgate  built a block of flats on his site Nos.1 to 6, Frances Court.  Unfortunately, as Mr High discovered, the foundations of this  block of flats encroached some feet below ground on to the land  forming part of No.77, Earlham Road, belonging to Mr High, on  which Mr High was proposing to build a house for himself.

Both Mr Westgate and Mr High were sensible and reasonable neighbours.  They entered into negotiations and it is clear, as found by the learned County Court Judge, that they reached an oral agreement that Mr Westgate should keep his foundations where they were, but in return Mr High should have a right of way across the yard adjoining the flats to a garage which Mr High intended to build close to the boundary of his land at the back of his house.

There was a meeting on the 2nd November, 1949, on the site between the parties and there were some letters. There were letters of the 6th and 12th December, 1949, referring to the oral agreement, and finally one on the 13th December, 1949, from Mr High in which he said (after referring to fences): 

"I shall be very glad to have the right you offer across the back of your site so that 1 can have access with a ear to the rear of my site.  Can you allow 8 ft. wide?  Perhaps you will kindly instruct your solicitor to write to my solicitors, Daynes Keefe & Co., Castle Meadow, Norwich, with the necessary agreement".

It has been argued that this was not a binding agreement on the principle of such cases as Chillingworth v. Esche. 1914, 1 Chancery at pages 113-114 (either a contract to make a contract or a conditional contract).  But I am satisfied that the agreement was a binding contract, and the parties merely contemplated that it would be put into proper form by a solicitor in the manner recognised in such eases as Rossiter v. Miller (1878) Law Reports, 3 Appeal Cases, page 124, and Bonnewell v. Jenkins, (1876) 8 Chancery Division, page 70.

Unfortunately, apparently no-one told Mr High that Ma prudent course, by reason of the Land Charges Act, 1925, and Section 199 of the Law of Property Act, 1925, was to register a land charge either as a Class C(iv) Estate Contract, or a Class D(iii) Equitable Easement.

Relying on his agreement with his neighbour, Mr High built his house with only a narrow passageway between his house and the neighbouring flats, so that he could not have had access with a car past his house that way. His house was completed nearly a year after the agreement of the 2nd November, 1949.  Mr Westgate sold his property (Nos. 73 and 75) to some people called Wright and conveyed it to them by a conveyance dated 14th March, 1950, which referred to Mr High's right of way.

Mr High was on good terms with the Wrights.  He used the right of way without question or demur both for pedestrians and for taking rubble off his site.  About the same time an 8 ft. wide opening was made in the wire fence separating No.75 from No.77 so as to allow access to No.77 from the yard of No.75.

During the Wrights' time the wire fence was replaced with a new wall, but the 8 ft. gap was preserved. Mrs Wright was consulted about this, as the wall of Mr High's garage, which he built in 1959 immediately opposite the 8 ft. gap, was included in this new boundary wall.  The garage was constructed in such a way that it could only be entered from the yard of No.75 and Mr High could only drive out over that yard.  Further, the learned County Court Judge accepted Mr High's evidence that the Wrights watched the garage being built and complimented him on it.  They knew that the only access to it was through the yard of No.75.  In 1960 Mr High bought a car, as ha had anticipated, and thereafter used the garage and the access over the yard in connection with it.

In 1962 Mr High tendered for and was given the job of resurfacing the yard and in his bill he deducted one-fifth of the cost, obviously because he was a user of the yard, and the bill was duly paid.

Towards the end of 1962 the Wrights offered Frances Court for sale by auction and by Special Condition No.9 provided for the continuance of Mr High's right of way.  The property was bought by the plaintiff company and was conveyed to them by a conveyance dated the 1st January, 1963, in which (at the suggestion of the plaintiff company's solicitors) the conveyance was subject to Mr High's right of way "if any".

A few months later the plaintiffs challenged Mr High's right of way. The plaintiff company's solicitors changed their ground several times, but finally these proceedings were started by the plaintiff company in 1965.  His Honour Judge Carey 'Evans decided in Mr High's favour on the 28th April, 1966, and dismissed the action.  From that decision the plaintiff company appeals.

One point argued on behalf of the plaintiff company was that they had acquired title to the land occupied by the foundations under the Limitation Act, 1939.  They and their predecessors in title have, of course, continued to enjoy the foundations which encroached on Mr High's land.  They are still there.  But it is quite clear that this occupation of the soil was permissive by reason of the oral agreement of the 2nd November, 1949, and not as of right. It is said, however, that the owners of Nos. 73 and 75 enjoyed the foundations under a tenancy at will and the plaintiff company claim that the statutory provisions accordingly started the time running at the end of the first year of such a tenancy and more than 13 years have run from the beginning of such a tenancy.

This in my opinion will not do.  No tenancy was contemplated or created, and the statutory provisions relating to a tenancy at will have no application.

It is necessary, in connection with Mr High's case, to consider the effect of the Land Charges Act, 1925, and Section 199 of the Law of Property Act, 1925.  The effect of the pro-visions of the Land Charges Act, 1955, Sections 10 and 13, is to make Mr High's right of way, so far as it ought to have been registered as an Estate Contract or an Equitable Easement, either void or unenforceable, and Section 199 of the Law of Property Act, 1925, prevents express notice of Mr High's rights being effective in any way, though the plaintiff company bought subject to the right of way and had the moat positive notice of it.

But that is not the end of the matter.  There is another equitable ground on which Mr High's rights may be protected, which has nothing whatever to do with the Land Charges Act.  It is discussed in Snell's Equity (26th Edition) at pages 629-633 under the name "Proprietary estoppel", and the comment is made (page 633) that "the doctrine thus displays equity at its moat flexible".  There are two aspects in which this equitable principle applies in the present case.  Firstly, in the present case Mr High, in reliance on the arrangement made with Mr Westgate, allowed the encroaching foundations to remain on his land and built his house without proper access except ever the yard, and finally built his garage in such a way that it was useless unless access to it and from it could be had over the yard.  Mr Westgate acquiesced in the use of the yard for access and the Wrights stood by and, indeed, encouraged Mr High to build his garage in these conditions and for these purposes. Could anything be more monstrous and inequitable afterwards to deprive Mr High of the benefit of what he has done?

Secondly, the Wrights had continued to enjoy the benefit of the encroaching foundations on Mr High's land.  It would no doubt be quite an expensive job to remove the encroaching foundations and provide other support for the building. Equity does not allow a person who takes advantage of such a situation to deny to the other party the corresponding benefits which ware the consideration for allowing the foundations to remain.

The plaintiff company bought the property subject to Mr High's equitable rights and the property was so conveyed to them.  They had full knowledge of the situation, yet they continue to enjoy the benefits of the situation and wish to deny to Mr High the benefit of what he was induced to do in reliance on the mutual arrangement.  As long as the plaintiff company continue to enjoy the foundations, they must accept the terms of that enjoyment.

This is not a registrable charge, and Section 199 of the Law of Property Act, 1925, has no application.

I will now refer to the authorities in which support for these principles can be found.

Inwards v. Baker, 1965, 2 Queen's Bench, page 29 (a decision of this Court) is a modern example of the protection of equity which is given to a parson who is induced to expend money on land on reliance on representations by another.  I would like to refer to my observations in that ease at p.38: 

"In my view the ease comes plainly within the proposition stated in the eases.  It is not necessary, I think, to imply a promise. It seems to me that this is one of the cases of an equity created by estoppel, or equitable estoppel, as it is sometimes called, by which the person who has made the expenditure is induced by the expectation of obtaining protection, and equity protects him so that an injustice may not be perpetrated". 

Those words apply to the present case.

The principle there stated is not new.  It goes back at least as far as the observations of Lord Kingsdown in Ramadan v. Dyson (1866) Law Reports, 1 House of Lords, page 129 at page 170, which were approved by the Privy Council in Dimmer v. Wellington Corporation. (1884) Law Reports, 9 Appeal Cases, page 699.

In the same case (Inwards v. Baker) at page 37 Lord Denning pointed out that any purchaser who took with notice would clearly be bound by the equity.

The same principles were applied by Mr Justice Ungoed-Thomas in Ward v. Kirkland, 1966, 1 Weekly Law Reports, page 601.

Examples of the principle that a party cannot enjoy the benefits of an arrangement without giving effect to the burdens imposed on such benefits are to be found in Hopgood v. Brown. 1955, 1 Weekly Law Reports, page 213 (a decision of this Court relating to the use of drainage); and Halsall v. Brizell. 1957, 1 Chancery, page 169 (a decision of Mr Justice Upjohn, as he then was, holding that a successor in title could not use roads without bearing the burden of the contributions to upkeep imposed under the original terms).

In my opinion the learned County Court Judge reached the right conclusion, and I would dismiss the appeal. 

LORD JUSTICE WINN: This dispute between neighbours reveals the typical characteristic of such disputes that they are imbued with a degree of acrimony unrelated to their magnitude.  However, it should be said emphatically that in the instant case Mr High, the defendant in the County Court, has behaved with complete propriety, albeit imprudently, inasmuch as he failed to secure his position by seeking legal advice and taking the appropriate steps to make it impregnable.

The history of the events which have called for the consideration of the Court begins with a trespass upon the land of Mr High in the year 1949, committed by his then neighbour, a Mr Westgate, a predecessor in title of the plaintiffs in this action.  Mr Westgate, having begun building operations for the erection of a block of flats, caused or permitted the footings forming part of the foundation of the west wall of his building to intrude to an extent of some 14 inches over his boundary with the land of Mr High, at and below a depth of some 8 feet beneath the surface.  This Mr Westgate and Mr High had acquired adjoining plots of land on a bomb site, on which plots respectively they, being builders, were minded, after clearing the ground of the rubble from the buildings destroyed by enemy action, to build, in Mr Westgate's case the flats referred to, and in Mr High's ease a house for his own occupation: Mr Westgate's plot lay to the eastward of Mr High's, being bounded on the east by Belvoir Street: both plots were bounded on the south by Earlham Road,  In October 1949 Mr High became aware of the intrusion of the footings and summoned Mr Westgate to a meeting on the site which was attended by others, including a representative of the limited company controlled by Mr Westgate which was to erect the flats.  At this meeting it was established and fully accepted that the footings did so intrude into the land of Mr High and, at least tacitly, that Mr High was entitled to have them removed; this would, of course, have been an expensive and labour-consuming task, though at the early stage of construction then reached not so grave a matter as such removal progressively would have become as and when a wall and other parts of the intended building were placed in position,

A friendly and mutually sympathetic discussion took place at which, as the learned County Court Judge found - and I have no doubt whatsoever rightly found - a concluded agreement was orally made between Mr High and Mr Westgate.  It is true that a week or two after this meeting Mr High, having become somewhat impatient, wrote a letter consistent either with an inclination to withdraw from an agreement already made or an assertion that the matter remained open for further negotiation: I take the view that the former of these two interpretations should be put upon that letter, and that neither its terms nor a reference to be found in Mr High's next letter, written in reply to an intervening letter from Mr Westgate, to his expectation that solicitors would prepare "the necessary agreement", puts this ease into the category of cases exemplified by Von Hatzenfeldt Wildenberg v. Alexander; Chillingworth v. Esche and many other eases.  It was undoubtedly a term of the agreement so made that Mr Westgate, whose plan for the flats to be erected would leave an open area or yard behind, that is to say, to the north of the building with an access to the eastward to Belvoir Street, would permit Mr High to exercise a right of way to and from that street across that area or yard to and from the eastern boundary of Mr High's land for use on foot or with vehicles.  It is equally clear that Mr High agreed with Mr West-gate that he would not complain of or take any steps to secure the removal of the footings projecting under his land.

In the County Court proceedings and before this Court the dispute has centred upon the effect in law of that agreement and the extent to which, if at all, it can operate to secure for Mr High the continued user of the right of way for which he so bargained, due regard being had to the provisions of the Land Charges Act, 1925, and of Section 199 of the Law of Property Act, 1925, in the light of the changes in ownership of the land formerly owned by Mr Westgate which have occurred since 1949, the conduct of the parties who have held and now hold the title to that land, and the fact that the footings are still in the same position, where the plaintiffs in the present action assert that they are entitled to have them left undisturbed. The argument has involved many niceties of a somewhat technical and esoteric character.

The substance of the dispute is whether Mr High's claim to be entitled to cross the yard behind the plaintiffs' block of flats, called Francis Court, on foot and in a ear, which the plaintiffs sought by their claim in this action to deny and destroy and the claim of the plaintiffs to be free in law to maintain the footings of the west wall of their flats in Mr High's land, are interdependent or, by contrast, so mutually separate and independent, in fact or in law, that the plaintiffs can both maintain their claim and bar that of Mr High.  There is a subsidiary but important question whether Mr High's claim, if valid, is only a personal right; this does not fall to be now decided.

I have found it simple to decide in my own mind that Mr High and Mr Westgate intended and mutually communicated by words or conduct the intention that NT High's plot of land should for an indefinite time (a) enjoy the adjunct of a right of way to and from Belvoir Street and the eastern boundary of the plot 8 feet wide, for use on foot or in a ear, (b) be subject to the detriment of the presence in the plot of such footings as existed there in November 1949: further, such intention, by necessary inference, fixed as the event upon which this arrangement would terminate any future removal of the protruding footings.  It would have been wholly inconsistent with their intention, on the traditional "officious bystander" test, that it should have been left to the choice or whim of Mr High or any successor in title to his plot to require at any time the removal of the footings, even upon simultaneously abandoning any claim to the right of way.

It is, however, far from a simple matter to have to envisage, as I think one must, in terms of legal concepts what effect was produced by that arrangement made with that intention. On the one hand, I accept Mr Goulding's submission that it comprised a contract by Mr Westgate to grant a legal easement, which was equivalent in equity to an equitable easement, and his further submission that such contract or easement was by force of Section 13(2) of the Land Charges Act, 1925 void against any subsequent purchaser for value of Mr Westgate's property, if unregistered, despite any notice of it which such purchaser might have had before purchasing.  On the other hand, I am unable to accept his submission that a tenancy at will arose in favour of Mr Westgate in respect of the subterranean space occupied by the footings.  Some legal fictions are valuable and may conveniently be used, but properly only constructively to make good lacunae in imperfectly comprehended arrangements: to impose an effect in law inconsistent with that mutually intended by the parties is, in my opinion, a function of such a device which cannot, or at least should not, it avoidable, be tolerated. In determining whether any, and if so what, tenancy has come into existence, the intention of the suggested parties is of paramount importance of per Lord Justice Denning in Errington v. Errington 1952, 1 King's Bench, page 290 at page 296: 

"In my opinion it is of the essence of a tenancy at will that it should be determinable by either party on demand and it is quite clear that the relationship of these parties was not so determinable ....It is, therefore, not a tenancy at will". 

And at page 297, quoting Lord Greene, Master of the Rolls, in Booker v. Palmer. 1942, 2 All England Reports, page 674 at page 677: 

"To suggest there is an intention there to create a relationship of landlord and tenant appears to me to be quite impossible. There is one golden rule which is of very general application, namely, that the law does net impute intention to enter into legal relationships where the circumstances and the conduct of the parties negative any intention of the kind."

Mr Westgate would certainly not have bean willing to rely on a tenancy at will.  For my part I do not envisage any tenancy of the subterranean space, but supposing, arguendo, that one is to be deemed, I would think that a tenancy at sufferance would more nearly fit the reality of the arrangement.  For this reason I reject the submission that a limitation period of twelve years, running from the expiry of the first year of a tenancy at will, now bars a claim for trespass by the protruding footings if there was a tenancy by sufferance, it was not terminated before Mr High's alleged trespass or in anticipation of the present action.

Licence to maintain the footings is, to my mind, the concept which is far preferable: whilst recognising that a licence could not run with the land of either licensor or licensee, I have no difficulty in supposing that both intended that the licence should be, or that it was, periodically renewable and renewed between the persons from time to time concerned that it should apply.

In my judgment the protrusion of the footings was permitted by licence until but not after the counterclaim in this action was filed.

During the twelve years from 1950 to 1962 purchasers from Mr Westgate of his plot of land, a Flt. Lt. Wright and his wife managed and from time to time resided in Francis Court. They not only licensed Mr High, as had Mr Westgate, to pass over the yard, probably motivated by their knowledge that their footings protruded, but allowed and even encouraged his when he proposed to build himself a garage on his eastern boundary so that, after he first bought a car in about 1960, he could drive it in and out across their yard: they also accepted a contribution from him to the coat of resurfacing that yard.  Thus they represented to him that he had a right so to do.  A very clear equity and also an estoppel thus arose against them preventing them from denying Mr High user of the right of way.  cf. per Mr Justice Upjohn in Halsall & ors v. Brizell & anr., 1957, 1 Chancery, page 169 at page 182.  It is, however, to be observed that that case related acre specifically to benefits and burdens arising under a deed and held that such benefits could not be taken without assuming also the burdens.  cf. also Inwards v. Baker, 1965, 2 Queen's Bench, page 29, a ease of standing by with knowledge that expenditure was being incurred in reliance upon conduct of the party against whom an equity was therefore held to arise.  Notice of this equity, which amounted to an equitable easement, was given in paragraph 9 of the particulars of the auction at which the plaintiffs bought Francis Court, and the land on which it stood, and by the draft of the conveyance of the property.

In my opinion the plaintiffs as successors in title are bound by that estoppel: I do not regard myself as thereby saying anything contradictory of the proposition submitted to the Court that the said equity or equitable easement) as distinct from the estoppel, was rendered void as against the plaintiffs by the statutes to which I have referred.  Estoppels arising from representations made by owners of land that rights exist affecting their land will, unless in form they are limited to the duration of the interest of the representor, bind successors to his title.  It is no anomaly that a person should have a legally valid answer to a claim and yet be estopped from asserting that answer against the claimant; citation of examples would be otiose and one should suffice; a tenant under a lease, in occupation, is estopped from setting up against his lessor, or an assignee, when sued by him for e.g. rent, any denial that the lessor had an estate in the demised premises entitling him to grant that lease. Where estoppel applies, the person entitled to wield it as a shield has, ex hypothesi, suffered a past detriment or other change of position; he is not asserting any positive right but is invoking law or equity to afford him procedural protection to avert injustice.

Such equities as arise from merely standing by whilst expenditure is incurred under a mistake of fact or law, or from attempts both to approbate and reprobate a deed, always supposing them to be capable of registration, which is I think on the whole an open question, may not survive the lethal effect of the Land Charges Act unless they have been registered.  On the other hand, I cannot see that the statute has any impact upon an estoppel, nor do I think that an estoppel could be registrable under its provisions.

It follows in my judgment that the County Court Judge, in an admirably thorough and well reasoned judgment, case to a conclusion on the plaintiffs' claim which I would affirm. As the counterclaim is before us and counsel agree that we should deal with it, I would determine it by declaring that the footings would constitute an actionable trespass unless Mr High and his successors in title were allowed to use the right of way stipulated for in 1949.

I would dismiss this appeal.

Order: Appeal dismissed with costs, such costs to include the costs of the respondent's notice.  Leave to appeal to the House of Lords refused.

THE MASTER OF THE ROLLS: (read by LORD JUSTICE WINN): During the War the City of Norwich was bombed by the enemy.  Three houses in Earlham Road were demolished and their sites left vacant.  In May 1949 Mr High bought the site of 77, Earlham Road and started to build a house on it.  He was a builder and he intended to live in it himself.  About the same time Mr Westgate bought the adjoining sites of 73 and 75 Earlham Road and started to build a block of flats on the double site.  In the course of the work Mr Westgate encroached on to Mr High's site.  Mr Westgate dug down nine feet to lay the foundations of the block of flats and he put the footings and foundations twelve inches over the boundary into Mr High's land.  Above ground level, the wall of the block of flats was to be on the boundary line, but below ground level, the foundations trespassed a good twelve inches over the boundary.

Mr High at once objected to the trespass.  On the 2nd November, 1949, there was a meeting on the site between Mr High and Mr Westgate, a surveyor, an architect and others. Mr Westgate admitted the trespass.  Mr High could have compelled Mr Westgate to remove the foundations.  But instead of doing so, Mr High came to this agreement with Mr Westgate:

On the one hand, Mr Westgate was to be at liberty to keep the foundations of the block of flats as they ware in Mr High's land; and Mr Westgate was to build up the wall of the flats on that side with no windows or openings on to Mr High's land.

On the other hand, Mr High was to have a right of way from the back of his own house (then being built) across the yard of Mr Westgate's block of flats so as to give access to a side road, Belvoir Street.  (At that time, in November 1949, Mr High had not got a oar, but he hoped to get one some day and desired access for it).

After the agreement was made, letters passed evidencing it.  There was a suggestion that the solicitors should be instructed to draw up a written agreement, but it was never done. On this account it was suggested before us that there was no concluded agreement.  But the Judge was satisfied there was.

So am I.  The agreement was complete.  All that was suggested was to put it into form.

Both sides acted on the agreement.  Mr Westgate went on building his block of flats with the foundations encroaching into Mr High's land, and no windows or openings on that side. Mr High built his house in such a way that the only practicable access by car was across the yard at the back of Mr Westgate's block of flats.

In March 1950 Mr Westgate sold his site to Mr and Mrs Wright.  The conveyance made no mention of the foundations or of the right of way for Mr High.  But the Judge inferred that the Wrights were told about the agreement.  Soon afterwards Mr High finished his house. The block of flats ware finished. Mr High used the way across the yard.

In 1959 Mr High built a garage at the back of his house, No.77.  In doing so he relied on the right of way given him in 1949.  He so constructed his garage that it could only be entered from the yard of the Wrights' block of flats and the ear could only be driven in and out over that yard.  The Wrights 'watched the garage being built and complimented Mr High on it. Next year Mr High bought a car and thereafter continually garaged it in his garage and went in and out across the Wrights' yard - which was the only means of access.

In the next year, 1960, the Wrights got Mr High to resurface the yard.  The cost was Â£14.10a.0d.  The Wrights had four garages for their flats.  Mr High had his one.  Mr High paid one-fifth of the coat.  Thus the Wrights recognised that he used the yard to get to and from his garage.

On the 27th November, 1962, the Wrights put up the block of flats for sale by auction.  The particulars of sale stated distinctly that there was a right of way for Mr High, saying: 

"The property is also sold subject to the right of the owners and occupiers of No.77 Earlham Road as now enjoyed to pass and repass with or without vehicles over the open yard to and from Belvoir Street".

At the auction the property was sold to E.R.Ives Investments Ltd. During the investigation of title the purchasers' solicitors asked: "How did the right of way over the yard in favour of No.77 Earlham Road arise?".  The vendors' solicitors replied: "We imagine that this arose as a result of the destruction of No.73 and No.75 during the War.  Presumably No.77 was given a right of way over the yard in lieu of over the 4 ft. wide passageway, but we cannot trace any document in connection therewith".

On the 1st January, 1963, the conveyance was made by the Wrights to E.R.Ives Investments Ltd.  It expressly stated that the property was conveyed subject "to the right (if any) of the owners and occupiers of No.77 Earlham Road as now enjoyed to pass and repass with or without vehicles over the open yard at the rear of the block of flats to and from Belvoir Street".

Now here is the point.  The right of way was never registered as a land charge.  The purchasers, E.R.Ives Investments Ltd., say that it should have been registered under Class C (iv) as an Estate Contract, or under Class D (iii) as an Equitable Easement: and that, as it was not registered, it is void against them, the purchasers.  Even though they had the most explicit notice of it, nevertheless they say it is void against them.  They claim to be entitled to prevent Mr High having any access to his garage across their yard: and thus render it useless to him.  They have brought an action for an injunction to stop him crossing the yard at all.

One thing is quite clear.  Apart from this point about the Land Charges Act, 1925, Mr High would have in equity a good right of way across the yard.  This right arises in two ways:-

1. Mutual benefit and burden.
The right arises out of the agreement of the 2nd November, 1949, and the subsequent action taken on it: on the principle that "he who takes the benefit must accept the burden".  When adjoining owners of land make an agreement to secure continuing rights and benefits for each of them in or over the land of the other, neither of them can take the benefit of the agreement and throw over the burden of it.  This applies not only to the original parties, but also to their successors.  The successor who takes the continuing benefit must take it subject to the continuing burden.  This principle has been applied to neighbours who send their water into a common drainage system, see Hopgood v. Brown, 1955, 1 Weekly Law Reports, page 213: and to purchasers of houses on a building estate who had the benefit of using the roads and were subject to the burden of contributing to the upkeep, see Halsall v. Brizell 1957 Chancery, page 169.  The principle clearly applies in the present case.  The owners of the block of flats have the benefit of having their foundations in Mr High's land.  So long as they take that benefit, they must shoulder the burden.  They must observe the condition on which the benefit was granted, namely, they must allow Mr High and his successors to have access over their yard, of. May v. Belleville. 1905, 2 Chancery, page 605.  Conversely, so long as Mr High takes the benefit of the access, he must permit the block of flats to keep their foundations in his land. 

2. Equity arising out of acquiescence: 
The right arises out of the expense incurred by Mr High in building his garage, as it is now, with access only over the yard: and the Wrights standing by and acquiescing in it, knowing that he believed he had a right of way over the yard.  By so doing the Wrights created in Mr High's mind a reasonable expectation that his access over the yard would not be disturbed.  That gives rise to an "equity arising out acquiescence".  It is available not only against the Wrights but also their successors in title.  The Court will not allow that expectation to be defeated when it would be inequitable so to do.  It is for the Court in each case to decide in what way the equity can be satisfied, see Inwards v. Baker, 1965, 2 Queen's Bench, page 29: Ward v. Kirkland, 1966, 1 Weekly Law Reports, page 621, and the cases cited therein.  In this case it could only be satisfied by allowing Mr High and his successors to have access over the yard so long as the block of flats has its foundations in his land.

The next question is this: Was that right a land charge such as to need registration under the Land Charges Act, 1925? For if it was a land charge, it was never registered and would be void as against any purchaser, see Section 13 of the Act. It would, therefore, be void against ER Ives Investments Ltd v JW High, even though they took with the most express knowledge and notice of the right.

It was suggested that the agreement of the 2nd November, 1949, was "an estate contract" within Class C(iv).  I do not think so.  There was no contract by Mr Westgate to convey a legal estate of any kind.

It was next suggested that the right was an "equitable easement" within Class D (iii).  This class is defined as "any easement right or privilege over or affecting land created or arising after the commencement of this Act, and being merely an. equitable interest".  Those words are almost identical with Section 2(3)(iii)of the Law of Property Act, 1925, and should be given the same meaning.  They must be read in conjunction with Sections 1(2)(a), 1(3) and 4(1) of the Law of Property Act, 1925.  It then appears that an "equitable easement" is a proprietary interest in land such as would before 1926 have been recognised as capable of being conveyed or created at law, but which since 1926 only takes effect as an equitable interest. An instance of such a proprietary interest is a profit a'prendre for life. It does not include a right to possession by a requisitioning authority, see Lewisham Borough Council v. Maloney. 1948, 1 King's Bench, page 50.  Nor does it include a right, liberty or privilege arising in equity by reason of "mutual benefit and burden", or arising out of "acquiescence", or by reason of a contractual licence: because none of those before 1926 were proprietary interests such as were capable of being conveyed or created at law.  They only subsisted in equity. They do not need to be registered as land charges, so as to bind successors, but take effect in equity without registration, see an article by Mr C.V.Davidge on "Equitable Easements" in (1937) 59 Law Quarterly Review, page 259, and by Professor H.W.R. Wade in 1956 Cambridge Law Journal, pages 225-6.

The right of Mr High to cross this yard was not a right such as could ever have been created or conveyed at law. It subsisted only in equity.  It therefore still subsists in equity without being registered.  Any other view would enable the owners of the flats to perpetrate the grossest injustice. They could block up Mr High's access to the garage, whilst keeping their foundations in his land.  That cannot be right.

I am confirmed in this construction of the statute when I remember that there are many houses adjoining one another which have drainage systems in common, with mutual benefits and burdens.  The statute cannot have required all these to be registered as land charges.

I know that this greatly restricts the scope of Class D(iii) but this is not disturbing. A Special Committee has already suggested that Class D(iii) should be abolished altogether, see the Report of the Committee on Land Charges (1956) Command Paper 9825, paragraph 16.

In these circumstances it is not necessary to consider the counterclaim. I would only say that I do not think the owners of the block of flats have acquired a "squatter's title" to the space occupied by the foundations. They ware only licensees and cannot acquire a title by limitation. If they were entitled to block up Mr High's access over their yard, he would I think be entitled to require them to remove the foundations from his land. But, fortunately for them, no such consequence will befall them. They can keep their foundations there, but they must not block up or impede his access across their yard, with or without vehicles.

I would therefore dismiss the appeal.

LORD JUSTICE DANCKWERTS: This appeal from the decision of His  Honour Judge Carey Evans is concerned with property built on a  site made vacant by war damage fronting on Earlham Road and Belvoir Street, Norwich.  The respondent, Mr High, owned the site  of No.77, Earlham Road and Mr Westgate owned the sites of Nos.  73 and 75, Earlham Road.  They were both builders.  Mr Westgate  built a block of flats on his site Nos.1 to 6, Frances Court.  Unfortunately, as Mr High discovered, the foundations of this  block of flats encroached some feet below ground on to the land  forming part of No.77, Earlham Road, belonging to Mr High, on  which Mr High was proposing to build a house for himself.

Both Mr Westgate and Mr High were sensible and reasonable neighbours.  They entered into negotiations and it is clear, as found by the learned County Court Judge, that they reached an oral agreement that Mr Westgate should keep his foundations where they were, but in return Mr High should have a right of way across the yard adjoining the flats to a garage which Mr High intended to build close to the boundary of his land at the back of his house.

There was a meeting on the 2nd November, 1949, on the site between the parties and there were some letters. There were letters of the 6th and 12th December, 1949, referring to the oral agreement, and finally one on the 13th December, 1949, from Mr High in which he said (after referring to fences): 

"I shall be very glad to have the right you offer across the back of your site so that 1 can have access with a ear to the rear of my site.  Can you allow 8 ft. wide?  Perhaps you will kindly instruct your solicitor to write to my solicitors, Daynes Keefe & Co., Castle Meadow, Norwich, with the necessary agreement".

It has been argued that this was not a binding agreement on the principle of such cases as Chillingworth v. Esche. 1914, 1 Chancery at pages 113-114 (either a contract to make a contract or a conditional contract).  But I am satisfied that the agreement was a binding contract, and the parties merely contemplated that it would be put into proper form by a solicitor in the manner recognised in such eases as Rossiter v. Miller (1878) Law Reports, 3 Appeal Cases, page 124, and Bonnewell v. Jenkins, (1876) 8 Chancery Division, page 70.

Unfortunately, apparently no-one told Mr High that Ma prudent course, by reason of the Land Charges Act, 1925, and Section 199 of the Law of Property Act, 1925, was to register a land charge either as a Class C(iv) Estate Contract, or a Class D(iii) Equitable Easement.

Relying on his agreement with his neighbour, Mr High built his house with only a narrow passageway between his house and the neighbouring flats, so that he could not have had access with a car past his house that way. His house was completed nearly a year after the agreement of the 2nd November, 1949.  Mr Westgate sold his property (Nos. 73 and 75) to some people called Wright and conveyed it to them by a conveyance dated 14th March, 1950, which referred to Mr High's right of way.

Mr High was on good terms with the Wrights.  He used the right of way without question or demur both for pedestrians and for taking rubble off his site.  About the same time an 8 ft. wide opening was made in the wire fence separating No.75 from No.77 so as to allow access to No.77 from the yard of No.75.

During the Wrights' time the wire fence was replaced with a new wall, but the 8 ft. gap was preserved. Mrs Wright was consulted about this, as the wall of Mr High's garage, which he built in 1959 immediately opposite the 8 ft. gap, was included in this new boundary wall.  The garage was constructed in such a way that it could only be entered from the yard of No.75 and Mr High could only drive out over that yard.  Further, the learned County Court Judge accepted Mr High's evidence that the Wrights watched the garage being built and complimented him on it.  They knew that the only access to it was through the yard of No.75.  In 1960 Mr High bought a car, as ha had anticipated, and thereafter used the garage and the access over the yard in connection with it.

In 1962 Mr High tendered for and was given the job of resurfacing the yard and in his bill he deducted one-fifth of the cost, obviously because he was a user of the yard, and the bill was duly paid.

Towards the end of 1962 the Wrights offered Frances Court for sale by auction and by Special Condition No.9 provided for the continuance of Mr High's right of way.  The property was bought by the plaintiff company and was conveyed to them by a conveyance dated the 1st January, 1963, in which (at the suggestion of the plaintiff company's solicitors) the conveyance was subject to Mr High's right of way "if any".

A few months later the plaintiffs challenged Mr High's right of way. The plaintiff company's solicitors changed their ground several times, but finally these proceedings were started by the plaintiff company in 1965.  His Honour Judge Carey 'Evans decided in Mr High's favour on the 28th April, 1966, and dismissed the action.  From that decision the plaintiff company appeals.

One point argued on behalf of the plaintiff company was that they had acquired title to the land occupied by the foundations under the Limitation Act, 1939.  They and their predecessors in title have, of course, continued to enjoy the foundations which encroached on Mr High's land.  They are still there.  But it is quite clear that this occupation of the soil was permissive by reason of the oral agreement of the 2nd November, 1949, and not as of right. It is said, however, that the owners of Nos. 73 and 75 enjoyed the foundations under a tenancy at will and the plaintiff company claim that the statutory provisions accordingly started the time running at the end of the first year of such a tenancy and more than 13 years have run from the beginning of such a tenancy.

This in my opinion will not do.  No tenancy was contemplated or created, and the statutory provisions relating to a tenancy at will have no application.

It is necessary, in connection with Mr High's case, to consider the effect of the Land Charges Act, 1925, and Section 199 of the Law of Property Act, 1925.  The effect of the pro-visions of the Land Charges Act, 1955, Sections 10 and 13, is to make Mr High's right of way, so far as it ought to have been registered as an Estate Contract or an Equitable Easement, either void or unenforceable, and Section 199 of the Law of Property Act, 1925, prevents express notice of Mr High's rights being effective in any way, though the plaintiff company bought subject to the right of way and had the moat positive notice of it.

But that is not the end of the matter.  There is another equitable ground on which Mr High's rights may be protected, which has nothing whatever to do with the Land Charges Act.  It is discussed in Snell's Equity (26th Edition) at pages 629-633 under the name "Proprietary estoppel", and the comment is made (page 633) that "the doctrine thus displays equity at its moat flexible".  There are two aspects in which this equitable principle applies in the present case.  Firstly, in the present case Mr High, in reliance on the arrangement made with Mr Westgate, allowed the encroaching foundations to remain on his land and built his house without proper access except ever the yard, and finally built his garage in such a way that it was useless unless access to it and from it could be had over the yard.  Mr Westgate acquiesced in the use of the yard for access and the Wrights stood by and, indeed, encouraged Mr High to build his garage in these conditions and for these purposes. Could anything be more monstrous and inequitable afterwards to deprive Mr High of the benefit of what he has done?

Secondly, the Wrights had continued to enjoy the benefit of the encroaching foundations on Mr High's land.  It would no doubt be quite an expensive job to remove the encroaching foundations and provide other support for the building. Equity does not allow a person who takes advantage of such a situation to deny to the other party the corresponding benefits which ware the consideration for allowing the foundations to remain.

The plaintiff company bought the property subject to Mr High's equitable rights and the property was so conveyed to them.  They had full knowledge of the situation, yet they continue to enjoy the benefits of the situation and wish to deny to Mr High the benefit of what he was induced to do in reliance on the mutual arrangement.  As long as the plaintiff company continue to enjoy the foundations, they must accept the terms of that enjoyment.

This is not a registrable charge, and Section 199 of the Law of Property Act, 1925, has no application.

I will now refer to the authorities in which support for these principles can be found.

Inwards v. Baker, 1965, 2 Queen's Bench, page 29 (a decision of this Court) is a modern example of the protection of equity which is given to a parson who is induced to expend money on land on reliance on representations by another.  I would like to refer to my observations in that ease at p.38: 

"In my view the ease comes plainly within the proposition stated in the eases.  It is not necessary, I think, to imply a promise. It seems to me that this is one of the cases of an equity created by estoppel, or equitable estoppel, as it is sometimes called, by which the person who has made the expenditure is induced by the expectation of obtaining protection, and equity protects him so that an injustice may not be perpetrated". 

Those words apply to the present case.

The principle there stated is not new.  It goes back at least as far as the observations of Lord Kingsdown in Ramadan v. Dyson (1866) Law Reports, 1 House of Lords, page 129 at page 170, which were approved by the Privy Council in Dimmer v. Wellington Corporation. (1884) Law Reports, 9 Appeal Cases, page 699.

In the same case (Inwards v. Baker) at page 37 Lord Denning pointed out that any purchaser who took with notice would clearly be bound by the equity.

The same principles were applied by Mr Justice Ungoed-Thomas in Ward v. Kirkland, 1966, 1 Weekly Law Reports, page 601.

Examples of the principle that a party cannot enjoy the benefits of an arrangement without giving effect to the burdens imposed on such benefits are to be found in Hopgood v. Brown. 1955, 1 Weekly Law Reports, page 213 (a decision of this Court relating to the use of drainage); and Halsall v. Brizell. 1957, 1 Chancery, page 169 (a decision of Mr Justice Upjohn, as he then was, holding that a successor in title could not use roads without bearing the burden of the contributions to upkeep imposed under the original terms).

In my opinion the learned County Court Judge reached the right conclusion, and I would dismiss the appeal. 

LORD JUSTICE WINN: This dispute between neighbours reveals the typical characteristic of such disputes that they are imbued with a degree of acrimony unrelated to their magnitude.  However, it should be said emphatically that in the instant case Mr High, the defendant in the County Court, has behaved with complete propriety, albeit imprudently, inasmuch as he failed to secure his position by seeking legal advice and taking the appropriate steps to make it impregnable.

The history of the events which have called for the consideration of the Court begins with a trespass upon the land of Mr High in the year 1949, committed by his then neighbour, a Mr Westgate, a predecessor in title of the plaintiffs in this action.  Mr Westgate, having begun building operations for the erection of a block of flats, caused or permitted the footings forming part of the foundation of the west wall of his building to intrude to an extent of some 14 inches over his boundary with the land of Mr High, at and below a depth of some 8 feet beneath the surface.  This Mr Westgate and Mr High had acquired adjoining plots of land on a bomb site, on which plots respectively they, being builders, were minded, after clearing the ground of the rubble from the buildings destroyed by enemy action, to build, in Mr Westgate's case the flats referred to, and in Mr High's ease a house for his own occupation: Mr Westgate's plot lay to the eastward of Mr High's, being bounded on the east by Belvoir Street: both plots were bounded on the south by Earlham Road,  In October 1949 Mr High became aware of the intrusion of the footings and summoned Mr Westgate to a meeting on the site which was attended by others, including a representative of the limited company controlled by Mr Westgate which was to erect the flats.  At this meeting it was established and fully accepted that the footings did so intrude into the land of Mr High and, at least tacitly, that Mr High was entitled to have them removed; this would, of course, have been an expensive and labour-consuming task, though at the early stage of construction then reached not so grave a matter as such removal progressively would have become as and when a wall and other parts of the intended building were placed in position,

A friendly and mutually sympathetic discussion took place at which, as the learned County Court Judge found - and I have no doubt whatsoever rightly found - a concluded agreement was orally made between Mr High and Mr Westgate.  It is true that a week or two after this meeting Mr High, having become somewhat impatient, wrote a letter consistent either with an inclination to withdraw from an agreement already made or an assertion that the matter remained open for further negotiation: I take the view that the former of these two interpretations should be put upon that letter, and that neither its terms nor a reference to be found in Mr High's next letter, written in reply to an intervening letter from Mr Westgate, to his expectation that solicitors would prepare "the necessary agreement", puts this ease into the category of cases exemplified by Von Hatzenfeldt Wildenberg v. Alexander; Chillingworth v. Esche and many other eases.  It was undoubtedly a term of the agreement so made that Mr Westgate, whose plan for the flats to be erected would leave an open area or yard behind, that is to say, to the north of the building with an access to the eastward to Belvoir Street, would permit Mr High to exercise a right of way to and from that street across that area or yard to and from the eastern boundary of Mr High's land for use on foot or with vehicles.  It is equally clear that Mr High agreed with Mr West-gate that he would not complain of or take any steps to secure the removal of the footings projecting under his land.

In the County Court proceedings and before this Court the dispute has centred upon the effect in law of that agreement and the extent to which, if at all, it can operate to secure for Mr High the continued user of the right of way for which he so bargained, due regard being had to the provisions of the Land Charges Act, 1925, and of Section 199 of the Law of Property Act, 1925, in the light of the changes in ownership of the land formerly owned by Mr Westgate which have occurred since 1949, the conduct of the parties who have held and now hold the title to that land, and the fact that the footings are still in the same position, where the plaintiffs in the present action assert that they are entitled to have them left undisturbed. The argument has involved many niceties of a somewhat technical and esoteric character.

The substance of the dispute is whether Mr High's claim to be entitled to cross the yard behind the plaintiffs' block of flats, called Francis Court, on foot and in a ear, which the plaintiffs sought by their claim in this action to deny and destroy and the claim of the plaintiffs to be free in law to maintain the footings of the west wall of their flats in Mr High's land, are interdependent or, by contrast, so mutually separate and independent, in fact or in law, that the plaintiffs can both maintain their claim and bar that of Mr High.  There is a subsidiary but important question whether Mr High's claim, if valid, is only a personal right; this does not fall to be now decided.

I have found it simple to decide in my own mind that Mr High and Mr Westgate intended and mutually communicated by words or conduct the intention that NT High's plot of land should for an indefinite time (a) enjoy the adjunct of a right of way to and from Belvoir Street and the eastern boundary of the plot 8 feet wide, for use on foot or in a ear, (b) be subject to the detriment of the presence in the plot of such footings as existed there in November 1949: further, such intention, by necessary inference, fixed as the event upon which this arrangement would terminate any future removal of the protruding footings.  It would have been wholly inconsistent with their intention, on the traditional "officious bystander" test, that it should have been left to the choice or whim of Mr High or any successor in title to his plot to require at any time the removal of the footings, even upon simultaneously abandoning any claim to the right of way.

It is, however, far from a simple matter to have to envisage, as I think one must, in terms of legal concepts what effect was produced by that arrangement made with that intention. On the one hand, I accept Mr Goulding's submission that it comprised a contract by Mr Westgate to grant a legal easement, which was equivalent in equity to an equitable easement, and his further submission that such contract or easement was by force of Section 13(2) of the Land Charges Act, 1925 void against any subsequent purchaser for value of Mr Westgate's property, if unregistered, despite any notice of it which such purchaser might have had before purchasing.  On the other hand, I am unable to accept his submission that a tenancy at will arose in favour of Mr Westgate in respect of the subterranean space occupied by the footings.  Some legal fictions are valuable and may conveniently be used, but properly only constructively to make good lacunae in imperfectly comprehended arrangements: to impose an effect in law inconsistent with that mutually intended by the parties is, in my opinion, a function of such a device which cannot, or at least should not, it avoidable, be tolerated. In determining whether any, and if so what, tenancy has come into existence, the intention of the suggested parties is of paramount importance of per Lord Justice Denning in Errington v. Errington 1952, 1 King's Bench, page 290 at page 296: 

"In my opinion it is of the essence of a tenancy at will that it should be determinable by either party on demand and it is quite clear that the relationship of these parties was not so determinable ....It is, therefore, not a tenancy at will". 

And at page 297, quoting Lord Greene, Master of the Rolls, in Booker v. Palmer. 1942, 2 All England Reports, page 674 at page 677: 

"To suggest there is an intention there to create a relationship of landlord and tenant appears to me to be quite impossible. There is one golden rule which is of very general application, namely, that the law does net impute intention to enter into legal relationships where the circumstances and the conduct of the parties negative any intention of the kind."

Mr Westgate would certainly not have bean willing to rely on a tenancy at will.  For my part I do not envisage any tenancy of the subterranean space, but supposing, arguendo, that one is to be deemed, I would think that a tenancy at sufferance would more nearly fit the reality of the arrangement.  For this reason I reject the submission that a limitation period of twelve years, running from the expiry of the first year of a tenancy at will, now bars a claim for trespass by the protruding footings if there was a tenancy by sufferance, it was not terminated before Mr High's alleged trespass or in anticipation of the present action.

Licence to maintain the footings is, to my mind, the concept which is far preferable: whilst recognising that a licence could not run with the land of either licensor or licensee, I have no difficulty in supposing that both intended that the licence should be, or that it was, periodically renewable and renewed between the persons from time to time concerned that it should apply.

In my judgment the protrusion of the footings was permitted by licence until but not after the counterclaim in this action was filed.

During the twelve years from 1950 to 1962 purchasers from Mr Westgate of his plot of land, a Flt. Lt. Wright and his wife managed and from time to time resided in Francis Court. They not only licensed Mr High, as had Mr Westgate, to pass over the yard, probably motivated by their knowledge that their footings protruded, but allowed and even encouraged his when he proposed to build himself a garage on his eastern boundary so that, after he first bought a car in about 1960, he could drive it in and out across their yard: they also accepted a contribution from him to the coat of resurfacing that yard.  Thus they represented to him that he had a right so to do.  A very clear equity and also an estoppel thus arose against them preventing them from denying Mr High user of the right of way.  cf. per Mr Justice Upjohn in Halsall & ors v. Brizell & anr., 1957, 1 Chancery, page 169 at page 182.  It is, however, to be observed that that case related acre specifically to benefits and burdens arising under a deed and held that such benefits could not be taken without assuming also the burdens.  cf. also Inwards v. Baker, 1965, 2 Queen's Bench, page 29, a ease of standing by with knowledge that expenditure was being incurred in reliance upon conduct of the party against whom an equity was therefore held to arise.  Notice of this equity, which amounted to an equitable easement, was given in paragraph 9 of the particulars of the auction at which the plaintiffs bought Francis Court, and the land on which it stood, and by the draft of the conveyance of the property.

In my opinion the plaintiffs as successors in title are bound by that estoppel: I do not regard myself as thereby saying anything contradictory of the proposition submitted to the Court that the said equity or equitable easement) as distinct from the estoppel, was rendered void as against the plaintiffs by the statutes to which I have referred.  Estoppels arising from representations made by owners of land that rights exist affecting their land will, unless in form they are limited to the duration of the interest of the representor, bind successors to his title.  It is no anomaly that a person should have a legally valid answer to a claim and yet be estopped from asserting that answer against the claimant; citation of examples would be otiose and one should suffice; a tenant under a lease, in occupation, is estopped from setting up against his lessor, or an assignee, when sued by him for e.g. rent, any denial that the lessor had an estate in the demised premises entitling him to grant that lease. Where estoppel applies, the person entitled to wield it as a shield has, ex hypothesi, suffered a past detriment or other change of position; he is not asserting any positive right but is invoking law or equity to afford him procedural protection to avert injustice.

Such equities as arise from merely standing by whilst expenditure is incurred under a mistake of fact or law, or from attempts both to approbate and reprobate a deed, always supposing them to be capable of registration, which is I think on the whole an open question, may not survive the lethal effect of the Land Charges Act unless they have been registered.  On the other hand, I cannot see that the statute has any impact upon an estoppel, nor do I think that an estoppel could be registrable under its provisions.

It follows in my judgment that the County Court Judge, in an admirably thorough and well reasoned judgment, case to a conclusion on the plaintiffs' claim which I would affirm. As the counterclaim is before us and counsel agree that we should deal with it, I would determine it by declaring that the footings would constitute an actionable trespass unless Mr High and his successors in title were allowed to use the right of way stipulated for in 1949.

I would dismiss this appeal.

Order: Appeal dismissed with costs, such costs to include the costs of the respondent's notice.  Leave to appeal to the House of Lords refused.
