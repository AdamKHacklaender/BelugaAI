[
THE MASTER OF THE ROLLS:  We are here presented with a nice question. Is Smith v. East Elloe Rural District Council, 1956 Appeal Cases, page 736, a good authority? - or, Has it been overruled by Anisminic v. Foreign Compensation Commission, 1969 2 Appeal Cases, page 147?

Boston is an old port. It has a fine church, with its famous tower - the Boston Stump. The centre of the town has, however, in modern times become so congested with traffic that it has been necessary to make an inner relief road. The plan was launched as far back as 1965, but it was not till 1972 that the local authority took steps to acquire land compulsorily.  It was to be done in two stages. First, to acquire the land needed for the trunk road itself. Second, to acquire the land needed for the side roads giving access to the trunk road. In respect of each stage there was a public inquiry to consider objections.

The first inquiry (as to the trunk road itself) was held in September 1973. A firm of wine merchants called Bateman lodged objection on the ground that it would cut off the access to their yards. Now, in order to overcome that objection it is alleged that a secret assurance was given to Batemans by an officer of the Department of the Environment. Batemans were assured that at the second stage access would be given for the lorries by means of a lane called Craythorne Lane. This was a narrow lane leading out of the market place. Batemans were assured that at the second stage this lane would be widened so as to take their lorries. On getting that assurance, Batemans withdrew their objection at the first inquiry. That was a secret assurance, not known to the public at large.

Now, there was another trader, Mr Ostler, who was interested. He was a corn merchant. His premises were at a corner of the Market Place where Craythorne Lane led out of it. He had no idea that Craythorne Lane was going to be widened. If it was to remain a narrow lane (as he thought) his business would not be affected by the proposed road. So he did not lodge any objection to it.

The inquiry was held on the 11th and 12th September, 1973. The proposed new road was approved. It was followed by an order dated 28th March, 1974 under the Highways Act, 1959 for the stopping up of highways and constructing new ones: and an order dated 9th May, 1974- for the compulsory purchase of property needed in order to construct the proposed new road.

Now Mr Ostler makes this point. He did not know of the secret agreement with Batemans. If he had, he would have lodged objection at the first stage. But not knowing of it, he made no opposition. So the orders were made in his absence.

Now we come to the next item. In July 1974- the local authority made a supplementary order under which they proposed to widen Craythorne Lane itself. Now Mr Ostler did object to this. He thought that the widening of Craythorne Lane would injuriously affect his premises and his business: because they were at the corner of Craythorne Lane.

This second stage was the subject of another inquiry. It was held in December 1974- for four days. Mr Ostler instructed solicitors to object on his behalf. He gave evidence. He sought to refer to the past history.  In particular he wanted to say that he would have objected at the first stage if he had known that the whole project would affect his property. But he was not allowed to go into it. The Inspector said:  "Mr Ostler, I can't allow that evidence. We are here to discuss the Craythorne Lane scheme only". So his evidence was excluded on that point. The Inspector made his report, recommending the widening of Craythorne Lane. The Minister confirmed the Order in July 1975.

Two or three months later Mr Ostler got to know of the secret agreement with Batemans which had been made before the first inquiry. So in December 1975 he applied to the Divisional Court to quash, not the latest order in July 1975 about Craythorne Lane, but the earlier orders about the line of the trunk road and the acquisitions in consequence of it. He said that they were invalid. His case is that there was a want of natural justice and, further, that there was a want of good faith because of the secret agreement.

The Divisional Court thought that the authority of Smith v. East Elloe might have been shaken by the Anisminic case.  So they thought that there should be further evidence before them, such as evidence about the secret agreement and evidence as to whether or no there had been any lack of good faith or any want of natural justice. The Department feel that this taking of evidence would involve delay and hold up the work. So Mr Wolf has come to this Court by way of appeal.

The earlier orders were made in March and May 1974. Much work has been done in pursuance of them. We are told that 80 per cent of the land has been acquired and 90 per cent of the buildings demolished. Nevertheless, Mr Ostler seeks to say that now, nearly two years later, those orders should be upset and declared to be null and void or set aside.

Now it is quite clear that if Mr Ostler had come within six weeks, his complaint could and would have been considered by the Court. The relevant provision is contained in the Second Schedule of the Highways Act, 1959. It says: 

"If a person aggrieved by a scheme or order to which this Schedule applies desires to question the validity thereof, or of any provision contained therein, on the ground that it is not within the powers of this Act or on the ground that any requirement of this Act or of regulations made thereunder has not been complied with in relation thereto, he may, within six weeks from the date on which the notice required by the foregoing paragraph is first published, make an application for the purpose to the High Court".

That is a familiar clause which appears in many statutes or schedules to them. Although the words appear to restrict the clause to cases of ultra vires or non-compliance with regulations, nevertheless the Courts have interpreted them so as to cover cases of bad faith.  On this point the view of Lord Eadcliffe has been accepted (which he expressed in Smith v. East Elloe, 1956 A.C. at page 769)=  In addition this Court has held that under this clause a person aggrieved - who comes within six weeks - can upset a scheme or order if the Minister has taken into account considerations which he ought not to have done, or has failed to take into account considerations which he ought to have done, or has come to his decision without any evidence to support it, or has made a decision which no reasonable person could make. It was so held in the Ashbridge case, 1965 1 W.L.R, 1370, and the Minister did not dispute it. It has been repeatedly followed in this Court ever since and never disputed by any Minister. So it is the accepted interpretation. But the person aggrieved must come within six weeks. That time limit has always been applied.

That paragraph is succeeded by the following one, which is complementary to it:  

"Subject to the provisions of the last foregoing paragraph, a scheme or order to which this Schedule applies shall not, either before or after it has been made or confirmed, be questioned in any legal proceedings whatever, and shall become operative on the date on which the notice required by paragraph 1 of this Schedule is first published, or on such later date, if any, as may be specified in the scheme or order".

So those are the strong words, "shall not .... be questioned any legal proceedings whatever". They were considered by the House of Lords in Smith v. East Elloe, 1956 A.C, 751. A lady brought an action to set aside an order for compulsory purchase. The six weeks had long since expired. She said the order was induced by the fraud of the clerk to the local council. The majority of the House held that her claim should be struck out against the council, but they allowed it to go on as against the clerk. Mr Payton told us that afterwards she even failed to prove any fraud against the clerk. So the decision of the House itself was based on a hypothesis which turned out to be unfounded - just like Donoghue v. Stevenson. But even so it is a decision that the paragraph does bar an action to quash an order for compulsory purchase even though it is put on the ground of fraud - if it is brought after the six weeks.

Thirteen years later the House had to consider the Anisminic case, 1969 2 Appeal Cases, 147. It was on a very different provision. The Foreign Compensation Act, 1950 said that "The determination by the commission of any application made to them under this Act shall not be called in question in any court of law". The House held that that clause only applied to a real determination. It did not apply to a purported determination. They held that there had been no determination properly so called "by the Commission. So their decision could be called in question.

Some of their Lordships seem to have thrown doubt on Smith v. East Elloe.  See what Lord Reid said at page 170-171. But others thought it could be explained on the ground on which Mr Justice Browne explained it. Lord Pearce said; 

"I agree with Mr Justice Browne that it is not a compelling authority in the present case"; 

and Lord Wilberforce said: 

"After the admirable analysis of the authorities made by Mr Justice Browne ... no elaborate discussion of authority is needed."

I turn therefore to the Judgment of Mr Justice Browne. His Judgment is appended to the case.  He put Smith v. East Elloe (at page 244) as one of the "Cases in which the inferior tribunal has been found guilty of bias, or has acted in bad faith, or has disregarded the principles of natural justice". He said of those cases:  

"It is not necessary to decide it for the purposes of this case, but I am inclined to think that such decisions are not nullities but are good until quashed (compare the decision of the majority of the House of Lords in Smith v. East Elloe, that a decision made in bad faith cannot be challenged on the ground that it was made beyond powers and Lord Radcliffe's dissenting Speech)".

In these circumstances, I think that Smith v. East Elloe must still be regarded as good and binding on this Court.  It is readily distinguished from the Anisminic case. The points of difference are these:

First, in the Anisminic case the Act ousted the jurisdiction of the Court altogether. It precluded the Court from entertaining any complaint at any time about the determination. Whereas in the Smith v. East Elloe case the statutory provision has given the Court jurisdiction to inquire into complaints so long as the applicant came within six weeks. The provision is more in the nature of a limitation period than of a complete ouster. That distinction is drawn by-Professor Wade in his book on Administrative Law at pages 152-153, and by the late Professor de Smith in the latest edition  of Halsbury's Laws of England, Volume I, paragraph 22, note 14. 

Second, in the Anisminic case, the House was considering  a determination by a truly judicial body, the Foreign Compensation Tribunal, whereas in the Smith v. East Elloe case  the House was considering an order which was very much in the  nature of an administrative decision. That is a distinction which Lord Reid himself drew in Ridge v. Baldwin, in 1964 Appeal Cases, page 72. There is a great difference between the  two. In making a judicial decision, the tribunal considers  the rights of the parties without regard to the public interest.  But in an administrative decision (such as a compulsory purchase  order) the public interest plays an important part. The  question is, to what extent are private interests to be  subordinated to the public interest.

Third, in the Anisminic case the House had to consider the actual determination of the tribunal, whereas in the Smith v. East Elloe case the House had to consider the validity of the process by which the decision was reached.

So Smith v. East Elloe must still be regarded as the law in regard to this provision we have to consider here.

I would add this:  If this order were to be upset for want of good faith or for lack of natural justice, it could not to my mind be a nullity or void from the beginning. It would only be voidable. And as such, if it should be challenged promptly before much has been done under it, as Lord Radcliffe put it forcibly in Smith v. East Elloe, 1956 A.C, page 769: "But this argument is in reality a play on the meaning of the word nullity. An order" - and he is speaking of an order such as we have got here - "even if not made in good faith, is still an act capable of legal consequences.  It bears no brand of invalidity upon its forehead. Unless the necessary proceedings are taken at law to establish the cause of invalidity and to get it quashed or otherwise upset, it will remain as effective for its ostensible purpose as the most impeccable of orders. And that brings us back to the question that determines this case: Has Parliament allowed the necessary proceedings to be taken?" The answer which he gave was ''No". That answer binds us in this Court today.

Since the Anisminic case the Court considered the position in Routh v. Borough of Reading, unreported, 2nd December, 1970. Lord Justice Salmon, supported by Lord Justice Karminski and Lord Justice Cairns, held that Smith v. East Elloe was of good authority, even after the Anisminic case. In Scotland, too, it has been applied, in Hamilton v. Secretary of State for Scotland, reported in 1972 Scots Law Times, page 233.

Looking at it broadly, it seems to me that the policy underlying the statute is that when a compulsory purchase order has been made, then if it has been wrongly obtained or made, a person aggrieved should have a remedy. But he must come promptly. He must come within six weeks.  If he does so, the Court can and will entertain his complaint. But if the six weeks expire without any application being made, the Court cannot entertain it afterwards. The reason is because, as soon as that time has elapsed, the authority will take steps "to acquire property, demolish it and so forth. The public interest demands that they should be safe in doing so.  Take this very case. The inquiry was held in 1973. The orders made early in 1974. Much work has already been done under them. It would be contrary to the public interest that the demolition should be held up or delayed by further evidence or inquiries. I think we are bound by Smith v. East Elloe to hold that Mr Ostler is barred by the statute from now questioning these orders. They ought to be stopped at this moment. I would allow the appeal accordingly. 

LORD JUSTICE GOFF:  I agree. As long ago as 1965 or possibly even earlier, it was conceived that it was necessary to have a relief road in the town of Boston, and in 1965 the line of that road was settled. It is marked with a thick red line on the plan before us. In July 1972 the matter was carried further when proposals were published for the necessary compulsory purchase of the land required to make that road (coloured pink on our plan) and other lands required for access (coloured green). The proposals included stopping up a number of highways, and where that was to be done is indicated on our plan by blue colouring. Objections had to be lodged by the 28th October, 1972. There were a number of objections, and principally from some people called Bateman, who owned property near Craythorne Lane.

An inquiry was held on the 11th and 12th September, 1973 and, as the result of that, in May 1974 the proposals were confirmed and the necessary compulsory purchase order and stopping up orders became effective.

Very soon after that, in July 1974, a proposed supplementary compulsory purchase order was published which provided for the widening of Craythorne Lane, coloured orange on our plan, as a means of access to the green land, and so thereby to the new highway.

This involved acquiring part of the Respondent's property for demolition so that Craythorne Lane could be widened. He objected and an inquiry was held, which lasted four days, from the 12th to the 20th intermittently of December 1974, and again the proposal was approved by the Minister, this time on the 12th July, 1975.

Mr Ostler was present at the December inquiry and he urged reasons why his land should not be taken, and proposed alternatives; for example, that the means of access should be through Spayne Lane. All his points were heard and decided against him, and he raises no objection to that order. He complains that he wanted at the December inquiry to raise objections to the original proposals which had been confirmed in May 1974, but that the Inspector would not allow him to do so because that order had become final. He did not object at that time, and he says that that was because the plans gave no indication that his land would be affected. He now wishes to challenge the 1974 order and he has moved for a writ of certiorari for that purpose.

His case is that he has discovered two things: first, that there was a secret agreement between the local authority and Batemans, guaranteeing that the 1972 proposals would not be put into force until Craythorne Lane had been acquired as the relevant means of access; second, that in August 1973 the Minister, in exercise of powers conferred upon him by Section 57, subsection (1), of the Highways Act, 1971 transferred to himself the powers of the local authority over Craythorne Lane as a highway affected by the construction or improvement of a trunk road - that is the new road coloured pink - the effect of which was, he says, that the local authority and the Minister agreed that access should be through Craythorne Lane. He says that had he known about the Craythorne Lane proposals, he would have objected, and he alleges that there was fraud or mala fides because those proposals were suppressed and he was not allowed to know anything about them.

It is fair to say that the facts are in dispute, and if the matter went further, one would have to ascertain precisely what had happened. The local authority say indeed that Mr Ostler was consulted before the Minister's decision about the Craythorne Lane proposals and raised no objection, subject to the price being right.

But for the purposes of the present interlocutory application, we have to assume that a case of fraud or mala fides could be established. The question then arises whether the statutory provisions to which my Lord has referred bar any such case.

In the Smith v. East Elloe case the relevant provisions were in fact in paragraphs 15 and 16 of Schedule I to the Acquisition of Land (Authorisation Procedure) Act, 1946, but with one odd little exception they are identical with those to be found in the Second Schedule to the Highways Act of 1959} which applies in this case, paragraphs 2, 3 and 4. The oddity to which I have referred is that what is now contained in paragraphs 2 and 3 was combined in the old paragraph 15, and paragraph 16 opened with the words "Subject to the provisions of the last foregoing paragraph". Those words have been taken into paragraph 4 of the 1959 Act, although the preceding provisions are now split up into two paragraphs, and the reference should really be to paragraph 2, not paragraph 3, or, at any rate, to both of them. But I think it must be construed as applying to paragraphs 2 and 3, and, therefore, the provisions considered in Smith v. East Elloe are identical for all practical purposes with those in the Highways Act.

In my judgment, in Smith v. East Elloe the majority did definitely decide that those statutory provisions preclude the order from being challenged after the statutory period allowed, then by paragraph 15 and now by paragraph 2, and we are bound by that unless the Anisminic case has so cut across it that we are relieved from the duty of following Smith v. East Elloe and, indeed, bound not to follow it.

That raises a number of problems. With all respect to the learned Master of the Rolls and Professor Wade, I do myself find difficulty in distinguishing Anisminic, on the ground that in that case there was an absolute prohibition against recourse to the Court, whereas in the present case there is a qualified power for a limited period, because the majority in the Smith case said, either that fraud did not come within paragraph 15, so that, in effect, it was an absolute ouster, or that it made no difference to the construction if it did.

Nevertheless, it seems to me that the Anisminic case is distinguishable on two grounds. First, the suggestion made by Lord Pearce at page 201 of the report that Anisminic dealt with a judicial decision, and an administrative or executive decision might be different. I think it is. It is true that the Minister has been said to be acting in a quasi judicial capacity, but he is nevertheless conducting an administrative or executive matter, where questions of policy enter into and must influence his decision.

I would refer in support of that to a passage from the Speech of Lord Reid in the well known case of Ridge v. Baldwin, at page 72. I need not read it. It sets out what I have been saying.

Where one is dealing with a matter of that character and where, as my Lord has pointed out, the order is one which must be acted upon promptly, it is, I think, easier for the Courts to construe Parliament as meaning exactly what it said, that the matter cannot be questioned in any Court, subject to the right given by paragraph 2, where applicable, and where application is made in due time, then where, as in Anisminic, one is dealing with a statute setting up a judicial tribunal and defining its powers and the question is whether it has acted within them. I think that is supported by the passage in the Speech of Lord Reid in the Anisminic case at page 170, where he said:  

"But I do not think that it is necessary or even reasonable to construe the word 'determination' as including everything which purports to be a determination but which is in fact no determination at all"

The second ground of distinction is that the ratio in the Anisminic case was that the House was dealing simply with a question of jurisdiction, and not a case where the order is made within jurisdiction, but it is attacked on the ground of fraud or mala fides. There are, I am fully conscious, difficulties in the way of that distinction, because Lord Somervell in the Smith v. East Elloe case, at page 771, in his dissenting Speech, said that fraud does not make the order voidable but a nullity. Lord Reid said the same in the Anisminic case at page 170; and at page 199 Lord Pearce equated want of natural justice with lack of jurisdiction.

Nevertheless, despite those difficulties, I think there is a real distinction between the case with which the House was dealing in Anisminic and the case of Smith v. East Elloe on that ground, that in the one case the determination was a purported determination only, because the tribunal, however eminent, having misconceived the effect of the statute, acted outside its jurisdiction, and indeed without any jurisdiction at all, whereas here one is dealing with an actual decision made within jurisdiction though sought to he challenged.

It cannot he gainsaid that some of the Speeches in Anisminic do appear to cast doubts upon the correctness of the decision in Smith v. East Elloe, but it certainly was not expressly overruled, nor did any of their Lordships, as I see it, say that it was wrong. There are substantial differences, such as my Lord and I have indicated, between the two cases, and it seems to me that Smith v. East Elloe stands, is binding on this Court, and is a decision directly in point.

I would therefore allow the appeal on that ground, and I am fortified in this conclusion by what Lord Justice Cairns said in the unreported case of Routh at page 12 of the transcript before us. He said this:  

"It is a harsh rule, but it is expressly laid down in paragraphs 15 and 16 of Schedule I to the Acquisition of Land (Acquisition Procedure) Act, 194-6, and those paragraphs have been strictly interpreted by the House of Lords in the East Elloe case. By that decision we are bound, and the language of their Lordships in that case is, in my view, sufficient to cover the present case. A suggested possible loophole did emerge, not, I must say, from Mrs Routh's submissions, but from Mr Glover, who suggested that a possible distinction that Mrs Routh might be seeking to make was between a void and a voidable order. I think that the language of the Members of the House of Lords in the East Elloe case does cover both situations; and if further confirmation is needed it is to be found in the passage from the Judgment of Lord Justice Jenkins in the case of Woollett v. Minister of Agriculture to which Lord Justice Salmon has referred". 

There is no mention in any of the Judgments of the Anisminic case, and therefore one must proceed with a little caution, but it is difficult to imagine that their Lordships were unaware of it or overlooked it, and the passage which I have read does seem to be, expressed no doubt in better words than my own, exactly what I have been saying.

For these reasons, as I have said, I would allow the appeal. 

LORD JUSTICE SHAW:  I agree that this appeal should succeed, and I would respectfully adopt the reasons given by my Lord the Master of the Rolls.  The present case falls fairly and squarely within the decision determined by the majority opinion of the House of Lords in Smith v. East Elloe.  If that decision survives notwithstanding what was said in Anisminic, it follows that the restriction or limitation imposed by paragraphs 2-4 to the Second Schedule to the Highways Act, 1959, and paragraphs 15 and 16 of the First Schedule to the Acquisition of Land (Authorisation Procedure) Act, 1946 precludes any resort to the Court, whether by way of certiorari or otherwise, with the object of challenging the validity of the order in question on any ground whatsoever after the prescribed period of six weeks has expired.

It seems to me that the case of Anisminic can be distinguished on two or perhaps three grounds:  first, that the statutory order considered in that case, namely, the Foreign Compensation Order, prescribed the basis on which the Foreign Compensation Commission were to found a determination as to whether the substance of a claim was to be treated as established. This rendered the question of whether or not there had been a valid determination at all open to review in circumstances where it could be shown that the Commission Proceeded on a wrong view of the law.

Secondly, the determination considered in Anisminic could not in any circumstances have been a valid determination so that it was void ah initio, while the order in the present case, as in East Elloe, was one which could be arrived at as a proper order.

Lastly, in the East Elloe case it was the validity of the compulsory purchase order that was in question and not any ultimate question of payment of compensation, which, in the last resort, remains as a means of affording redress to a person who has been dispossessed against his will.

I would hold that the respective provisions of the Schedules to the Highways Act, 1959, and the Acquisition of Land (Authorisation Procedure) Act, 1946, operate to make that order wholly immune from any challenge whatsoever save within the limited period prescribed, and accordingly I would allow the appeal.

Order:  Appeal allowed; application for certiorari dismissed; no order for costs; leave to appeal refused.

THE MASTER OF THE ROLLS:  We are here presented with a nice question. Is Smith v. East Elloe Rural District Council, 1956 Appeal Cases, page 736, a good authority? - or, Has it been overruled by Anisminic v. Foreign Compensation Commission, 1969 2 Appeal Cases, page 147?

Boston is an old port. It has a fine church, with its famous tower - the Boston Stump. The centre of the town has, however, in modern times become so congested with traffic that it has been necessary to make an inner relief road. The plan was launched as far back as 1965, but it was not till 1972 that the local authority took steps to acquire land compulsorily.  It was to be done in two stages. First, to acquire the land needed for the trunk road itself. Second, to acquire the land needed for the side roads giving access to the trunk road. In respect of each stage there was a public inquiry to consider objections.

The first inquiry (as to the trunk road itself) was held in September 1973. A firm of wine merchants called Bateman lodged objection on the ground that it would cut off the access to their yards. Now, in order to overcome that objection it is alleged that a secret assurance was given to Batemans by an officer of the Department of the Environment. Batemans were assured that at the second stage access would be given for the lorries by means of a lane called Craythorne Lane. This was a narrow lane leading out of the market place. Batemans were assured that at the second stage this lane would be widened so as to take their lorries. On getting that assurance, Batemans withdrew their objection at the first inquiry. That was a secret assurance, not known to the public at large.

Now, there was another trader, Mr Ostler, who was interested. He was a corn merchant. His premises were at a corner of the Market Place where Craythorne Lane led out of it. He had no idea that Craythorne Lane was going to be widened. If it was to remain a narrow lane (as he thought) his business would not be affected by the proposed road. So he did not lodge any objection to it.

The inquiry was held on the 11th and 12th September, 1973. The proposed new road was approved. It was followed by an order dated 28th March, 1974 under the Highways Act, 1959 for the stopping up of highways and constructing new ones: and an order dated 9th May, 1974- for the compulsory purchase of property needed in order to construct the proposed new road.

Now Mr Ostler makes this point. He did not know of the secret agreement with Batemans. If he had, he would have lodged objection at the first stage. But not knowing of it, he made no opposition. So the orders were made in his absence.

Now we come to the next item. In July 1974- the local authority made a supplementary order under which they proposed to widen Craythorne Lane itself. Now Mr Ostler did object to this. He thought that the widening of Craythorne Lane would injuriously affect his premises and his business: because they were at the corner of Craythorne Lane.

This second stage was the subject of another inquiry. It was held in December 1974- for four days. Mr Ostler instructed solicitors to object on his behalf. He gave evidence. He sought to refer to the past history.  In particular he wanted to say that he would have objected at the first stage if he had known that the whole project would affect his property. But he was not allowed to go into it. The Inspector said:  "Mr Ostler, I can't allow that evidence. We are here to discuss the Craythorne Lane scheme only". So his evidence was excluded on that point. The Inspector made his report, recommending the widening of Craythorne Lane. The Minister confirmed the Order in July 1975.

Two or three months later Mr Ostler got to know of the secret agreement with Batemans which had been made before the first inquiry. So in December 1975 he applied to the Divisional Court to quash, not the latest order in July 1975 about Craythorne Lane, but the earlier orders about the line of the trunk road and the acquisitions in consequence of it. He said that they were invalid. His case is that there was a want of natural justice and, further, that there was a want of good faith because of the secret agreement.

The Divisional Court thought that the authority of Smith v. East Elloe might have been shaken by the Anisminic case.  So they thought that there should be further evidence before them, such as evidence about the secret agreement and evidence as to whether or no there had been any lack of good faith or any want of natural justice. The Department feel that this taking of evidence would involve delay and hold up the work. So Mr Wolf has come to this Court by way of appeal.

The earlier orders were made in March and May 1974. Much work has been done in pursuance of them. We are told that 80 per cent of the land has been acquired and 90 per cent of the buildings demolished. Nevertheless, Mr Ostler seeks to say that now, nearly two years later, those orders should be upset and declared to be null and void or set aside.

Now it is quite clear that if Mr Ostler had come within six weeks, his complaint could and would have been considered by the Court. The relevant provision is contained in the Second Schedule of the Highways Act, 1959. It says: 

"If a person aggrieved by a scheme or order to which this Schedule applies desires to question the validity thereof, or of any provision contained therein, on the ground that it is not within the powers of this Act or on the ground that any requirement of this Act or of regulations made thereunder has not been complied with in relation thereto, he may, within six weeks from the date on which the notice required by the foregoing paragraph is first published, make an application for the purpose to the High Court".

That is a familiar clause which appears in many statutes or schedules to them. Although the words appear to restrict the clause to cases of ultra vires or non-compliance with regulations, nevertheless the Courts have interpreted them so as to cover cases of bad faith.  On this point the view of Lord Eadcliffe has been accepted (which he expressed in Smith v. East Elloe, 1956 A.C. at page 769)=  In addition this Court has held that under this clause a person aggrieved - who comes within six weeks - can upset a scheme or order if the Minister has taken into account considerations which he ought not to have done, or has failed to take into account considerations which he ought to have done, or has come to his decision without any evidence to support it, or has made a decision which no reasonable person could make. It was so held in the Ashbridge case, 1965 1 W.L.R, 1370, and the Minister did not dispute it. It has been repeatedly followed in this Court ever since and never disputed by any Minister. So it is the accepted interpretation. But the person aggrieved must come within six weeks. That time limit has always been applied.

That paragraph is succeeded by the following one, which is complementary to it:  

"Subject to the provisions of the last foregoing paragraph, a scheme or order to which this Schedule applies shall not, either before or after it has been made or confirmed, be questioned in any legal proceedings whatever, and shall become operative on the date on which the notice required by paragraph 1 of this Schedule is first published, or on such later date, if any, as may be specified in the scheme or order".

So those are the strong words, "shall not .... be questioned any legal proceedings whatever". They were considered by the House of Lords in Smith v. East Elloe, 1956 A.C, 751. A lady brought an action to set aside an order for compulsory purchase. The six weeks had long since expired. She said the order was induced by the fraud of the clerk to the local council. The majority of the House held that her claim should be struck out against the council, but they allowed it to go on as against the clerk. Mr Payton told us that afterwards she even failed to prove any fraud against the clerk. So the decision of the House itself was based on a hypothesis which turned out to be unfounded - just like Donoghue v. Stevenson. But even so it is a decision that the paragraph does bar an action to quash an order for compulsory purchase even though it is put on the ground of fraud - if it is brought after the six weeks.

Thirteen years later the House had to consider the Anisminic case, 1969 2 Appeal Cases, 147. It was on a very different provision. The Foreign Compensation Act, 1950 said that "The determination by the commission of any application made to them under this Act shall not be called in question in any court of law". The House held that that clause only applied to a real determination. It did not apply to a purported determination. They held that there had been no determination properly so called "by the Commission. So their decision could be called in question.

Some of their Lordships seem to have thrown doubt on Smith v. East Elloe.  See what Lord Reid said at page 170-171. But others thought it could be explained on the ground on which Mr Justice Browne explained it. Lord Pearce said; 

"I agree with Mr Justice Browne that it is not a compelling authority in the present case"; 

and Lord Wilberforce said: 

"After the admirable analysis of the authorities made by Mr Justice Browne ... no elaborate discussion of authority is needed."

I turn therefore to the Judgment of Mr Justice Browne. His Judgment is appended to the case.  He put Smith v. East Elloe (at page 244) as one of the "Cases in which the inferior tribunal has been found guilty of bias, or has acted in bad faith, or has disregarded the principles of natural justice". He said of those cases:  

"It is not necessary to decide it for the purposes of this case, but I am inclined to think that such decisions are not nullities but are good until quashed (compare the decision of the majority of the House of Lords in Smith v. East Elloe, that a decision made in bad faith cannot be challenged on the ground that it was made beyond powers and Lord Radcliffe's dissenting Speech)".

In these circumstances, I think that Smith v. East Elloe must still be regarded as good and binding on this Court.  It is readily distinguished from the Anisminic case. The points of difference are these:

First, in the Anisminic case the Act ousted the jurisdiction of the Court altogether. It precluded the Court from entertaining any complaint at any time about the determination. Whereas in the Smith v. East Elloe case the statutory provision has given the Court jurisdiction to inquire into complaints so long as the applicant came within six weeks. The provision is more in the nature of a limitation period than of a complete ouster. That distinction is drawn by-Professor Wade in his book on Administrative Law at pages 152-153, and by the late Professor de Smith in the latest edition  of Halsbury's Laws of England, Volume I, paragraph 22, note 14. 

Second, in the Anisminic case, the House was considering  a determination by a truly judicial body, the Foreign Compensation Tribunal, whereas in the Smith v. East Elloe case  the House was considering an order which was very much in the  nature of an administrative decision. That is a distinction which Lord Reid himself drew in Ridge v. Baldwin, in 1964 Appeal Cases, page 72. There is a great difference between the  two. In making a judicial decision, the tribunal considers  the rights of the parties without regard to the public interest.  But in an administrative decision (such as a compulsory purchase  order) the public interest plays an important part. The  question is, to what extent are private interests to be  subordinated to the public interest.

Third, in the Anisminic case the House had to consider the actual determination of the tribunal, whereas in the Smith v. East Elloe case the House had to consider the validity of the process by which the decision was reached.

So Smith v. East Elloe must still be regarded as the law in regard to this provision we have to consider here.

I would add this:  If this order were to be upset for want of good faith or for lack of natural justice, it could not to my mind be a nullity or void from the beginning. It would only be voidable. And as such, if it should be challenged promptly before much has been done under it, as Lord Radcliffe put it forcibly in Smith v. East Elloe, 1956 A.C, page 769: "But this argument is in reality a play on the meaning of the word nullity. An order" - and he is speaking of an order such as we have got here - "even if not made in good faith, is still an act capable of legal consequences.  It bears no brand of invalidity upon its forehead. Unless the necessary proceedings are taken at law to establish the cause of invalidity and to get it quashed or otherwise upset, it will remain as effective for its ostensible purpose as the most impeccable of orders. And that brings us back to the question that determines this case: Has Parliament allowed the necessary proceedings to be taken?" The answer which he gave was ''No". That answer binds us in this Court today.

Since the Anisminic case the Court considered the position in Routh v. Borough of Reading, unreported, 2nd December, 1970. Lord Justice Salmon, supported by Lord Justice Karminski and Lord Justice Cairns, held that Smith v. East Elloe was of good authority, even after the Anisminic case. In Scotland, too, it has been applied, in Hamilton v. Secretary of State for Scotland, reported in 1972 Scots Law Times, page 233.

Looking at it broadly, it seems to me that the policy underlying the statute is that when a compulsory purchase order has been made, then if it has been wrongly obtained or made, a person aggrieved should have a remedy. But he must come promptly. He must come within six weeks.  If he does so, the Court can and will entertain his complaint. But if the six weeks expire without any application being made, the Court cannot entertain it afterwards. The reason is because, as soon as that time has elapsed, the authority will take steps "to acquire property, demolish it and so forth. The public interest demands that they should be safe in doing so.  Take this very case. The inquiry was held in 1973. The orders made early in 1974. Much work has already been done under them. It would be contrary to the public interest that the demolition should be held up or delayed by further evidence or inquiries. I think we are bound by Smith v. East Elloe to hold that Mr Ostler is barred by the statute from now questioning these orders. They ought to be stopped at this moment. I would allow the appeal accordingly. 

LORD JUSTICE GOFF:  I agree. As long ago as 1965 or possibly even earlier, it was conceived that it was necessary to have a relief road in the town of Boston, and in 1965 the line of that road was settled. It is marked with a thick red line on the plan before us. In July 1972 the matter was carried further when proposals were published for the necessary compulsory purchase of the land required to make that road (coloured pink on our plan) and other lands required for access (coloured green). The proposals included stopping up a number of highways, and where that was to be done is indicated on our plan by blue colouring. Objections had to be lodged by the 28th October, 1972. There were a number of objections, and principally from some people called Bateman, who owned property near Craythorne Lane.

An inquiry was held on the 11th and 12th September, 1973 and, as the result of that, in May 1974 the proposals were confirmed and the necessary compulsory purchase order and stopping up orders became effective.

Very soon after that, in July 1974, a proposed supplementary compulsory purchase order was published which provided for the widening of Craythorne Lane, coloured orange on our plan, as a means of access to the green land, and so thereby to the new highway.

This involved acquiring part of the Respondent's property for demolition so that Craythorne Lane could be widened. He objected and an inquiry was held, which lasted four days, from the 12th to the 20th intermittently of December 1974, and again the proposal was approved by the Minister, this time on the 12th July, 1975.

Mr Ostler was present at the December inquiry and he urged reasons why his land should not be taken, and proposed alternatives; for example, that the means of access should be through Spayne Lane. All his points were heard and decided against him, and he raises no objection to that order. He complains that he wanted at the December inquiry to raise objections to the original proposals which had been confirmed in May 1974, but that the Inspector would not allow him to do so because that order had become final. He did not object at that time, and he says that that was because the plans gave no indication that his land would be affected. He now wishes to challenge the 1974 order and he has moved for a writ of certiorari for that purpose.

His case is that he has discovered two things: first, that there was a secret agreement between the local authority and Batemans, guaranteeing that the 1972 proposals would not be put into force until Craythorne Lane had been acquired as the relevant means of access; second, that in August 1973 the Minister, in exercise of powers conferred upon him by Section 57, subsection (1), of the Highways Act, 1971 transferred to himself the powers of the local authority over Craythorne Lane as a highway affected by the construction or improvement of a trunk road - that is the new road coloured pink - the effect of which was, he says, that the local authority and the Minister agreed that access should be through Craythorne Lane. He says that had he known about the Craythorne Lane proposals, he would have objected, and he alleges that there was fraud or mala fides because those proposals were suppressed and he was not allowed to know anything about them.

It is fair to say that the facts are in dispute, and if the matter went further, one would have to ascertain precisely what had happened. The local authority say indeed that Mr Ostler was consulted before the Minister's decision about the Craythorne Lane proposals and raised no objection, subject to the price being right.

But for the purposes of the present interlocutory application, we have to assume that a case of fraud or mala fides could be established. The question then arises whether the statutory provisions to which my Lord has referred bar any such case.

In the Smith v. East Elloe case the relevant provisions were in fact in paragraphs 15 and 16 of Schedule I to the Acquisition of Land (Authorisation Procedure) Act, 1946, but with one odd little exception they are identical with those to be found in the Second Schedule to the Highways Act of 1959} which applies in this case, paragraphs 2, 3 and 4. The oddity to which I have referred is that what is now contained in paragraphs 2 and 3 was combined in the old paragraph 15, and paragraph 16 opened with the words "Subject to the provisions of the last foregoing paragraph". Those words have been taken into paragraph 4 of the 1959 Act, although the preceding provisions are now split up into two paragraphs, and the reference should really be to paragraph 2, not paragraph 3, or, at any rate, to both of them. But I think it must be construed as applying to paragraphs 2 and 3, and, therefore, the provisions considered in Smith v. East Elloe are identical for all practical purposes with those in the Highways Act.

In my judgment, in Smith v. East Elloe the majority did definitely decide that those statutory provisions preclude the order from being challenged after the statutory period allowed, then by paragraph 15 and now by paragraph 2, and we are bound by that unless the Anisminic case has so cut across it that we are relieved from the duty of following Smith v. East Elloe and, indeed, bound not to follow it.

That raises a number of problems. With all respect to the learned Master of the Rolls and Professor Wade, I do myself find difficulty in distinguishing Anisminic, on the ground that in that case there was an absolute prohibition against recourse to the Court, whereas in the present case there is a qualified power for a limited period, because the majority in the Smith case said, either that fraud did not come within paragraph 15, so that, in effect, it was an absolute ouster, or that it made no difference to the construction if it did.

Nevertheless, it seems to me that the Anisminic case is distinguishable on two grounds. First, the suggestion made by Lord Pearce at page 201 of the report that Anisminic dealt with a judicial decision, and an administrative or executive decision might be different. I think it is. It is true that the Minister has been said to be acting in a quasi judicial capacity, but he is nevertheless conducting an administrative or executive matter, where questions of policy enter into and must influence his decision.

I would refer in support of that to a passage from the Speech of Lord Reid in the well known case of Ridge v. Baldwin, at page 72. I need not read it. It sets out what I have been saying.

Where one is dealing with a matter of that character and where, as my Lord has pointed out, the order is one which must be acted upon promptly, it is, I think, easier for the Courts to construe Parliament as meaning exactly what it said, that the matter cannot be questioned in any Court, subject to the right given by paragraph 2, where applicable, and where application is made in due time, then where, as in Anisminic, one is dealing with a statute setting up a judicial tribunal and defining its powers and the question is whether it has acted within them. I think that is supported by the passage in the Speech of Lord Reid in the Anisminic case at page 170, where he said:  

"But I do not think that it is necessary or even reasonable to construe the word 'determination' as including everything which purports to be a determination but which is in fact no determination at all"

The second ground of distinction is that the ratio in the Anisminic case was that the House was dealing simply with a question of jurisdiction, and not a case where the order is made within jurisdiction, but it is attacked on the ground of fraud or mala fides. There are, I am fully conscious, difficulties in the way of that distinction, because Lord Somervell in the Smith v. East Elloe case, at page 771, in his dissenting Speech, said that fraud does not make the order voidable but a nullity. Lord Reid said the same in the Anisminic case at page 170; and at page 199 Lord Pearce equated want of natural justice with lack of jurisdiction.

Nevertheless, despite those difficulties, I think there is a real distinction between the case with which the House was dealing in Anisminic and the case of Smith v. East Elloe on that ground, that in the one case the determination was a purported determination only, because the tribunal, however eminent, having misconceived the effect of the statute, acted outside its jurisdiction, and indeed without any jurisdiction at all, whereas here one is dealing with an actual decision made within jurisdiction though sought to he challenged.

It cannot he gainsaid that some of the Speeches in Anisminic do appear to cast doubts upon the correctness of the decision in Smith v. East Elloe, but it certainly was not expressly overruled, nor did any of their Lordships, as I see it, say that it was wrong. There are substantial differences, such as my Lord and I have indicated, between the two cases, and it seems to me that Smith v. East Elloe stands, is binding on this Court, and is a decision directly in point.

I would therefore allow the appeal on that ground, and I am fortified in this conclusion by what Lord Justice Cairns said in the unreported case of Routh at page 12 of the transcript before us. He said this:  

"It is a harsh rule, but it is expressly laid down in paragraphs 15 and 16 of Schedule I to the Acquisition of Land (Acquisition Procedure) Act, 194-6, and those paragraphs have been strictly interpreted by the House of Lords in the East Elloe case. By that decision we are bound, and the language of their Lordships in that case is, in my view, sufficient to cover the present case. A suggested possible loophole did emerge, not, I must say, from Mrs Routh's submissions, but from Mr Glover, who suggested that a possible distinction that Mrs Routh might be seeking to make was between a void and a voidable order. I think that the language of the Members of the House of Lords in the East Elloe case does cover both situations; and if further confirmation is needed it is to be found in the passage from the Judgment of Lord Justice Jenkins in the case of Woollett v. Minister of Agriculture to which Lord Justice Salmon has referred". 

There is no mention in any of the Judgments of the Anisminic case, and therefore one must proceed with a little caution, but it is difficult to imagine that their Lordships were unaware of it or overlooked it, and the passage which I have read does seem to be, expressed no doubt in better words than my own, exactly what I have been saying.

For these reasons, as I have said, I would allow the appeal. 

LORD JUSTICE SHAW:  I agree that this appeal should succeed, and I would respectfully adopt the reasons given by my Lord the Master of the Rolls.  The present case falls fairly and squarely within the decision determined by the majority opinion of the House of Lords in Smith v. East Elloe.  If that decision survives notwithstanding what was said in Anisminic, it follows that the restriction or limitation imposed by paragraphs 2-4 to the Second Schedule to the Highways Act, 1959, and paragraphs 15 and 16 of the First Schedule to the Acquisition of Land (Authorisation Procedure) Act, 1946 precludes any resort to the Court, whether by way of certiorari or otherwise, with the object of challenging the validity of the order in question on any ground whatsoever after the prescribed period of six weeks has expired.

It seems to me that the case of Anisminic can be distinguished on two or perhaps three grounds:  first, that the statutory order considered in that case, namely, the Foreign Compensation Order, prescribed the basis on which the Foreign Compensation Commission were to found a determination as to whether the substance of a claim was to be treated as established. This rendered the question of whether or not there had been a valid determination at all open to review in circumstances where it could be shown that the Commission Proceeded on a wrong view of the law.

Secondly, the determination considered in Anisminic could not in any circumstances have been a valid determination so that it was void ah initio, while the order in the present case, as in East Elloe, was one which could be arrived at as a proper order.

Lastly, in the East Elloe case it was the validity of the compulsory purchase order that was in question and not any ultimate question of payment of compensation, which, in the last resort, remains as a means of affording redress to a person who has been dispossessed against his will.

I would hold that the respective provisions of the Schedules to the Highways Act, 1959, and the Acquisition of Land (Authorisation Procedure) Act, 1946, operate to make that order wholly immune from any challenge whatsoever save within the limited period prescribed, and accordingly I would allow the appeal.

Order:  Appeal allowed; application for certiorari dismissed; no order for costs; leave to appeal refused.

[
LORD JUSTICE BUCKLEY:  This is an appeal from a judgment of Mr Justice Goulding delivered on the 23rd May, 1975. The Order was not perfected until the 18th June, 1975, which date it hears. The Defendant was ordered to deliver possession of a dwellinghouse, 56 Queen's Gate Mews, Kensington, to the Plaintiff mortgagee on or before the 23rd June, 1975, allowing the Defendant one month from the date of judgment to get out. The facts of the case are very clearly set out in the judgment of the learned Judge and I do not propose to recapitulate them. On the 23rd May, 1975 the Defendant issued a summons asking for an extension of time to vacate the property. This came before the Master of the 11th June, 1975, when he stood the summons over for cross-examination of the Defendant to take place on the 23rd June, 1975. On the last mentioned date the Defendant applied to Mr Justice Goulding for a stay of the Order, pending an appeal. The appointment before the Master was consequently  vacated. The Judge made no Order upon the application for stay, the Plaintiff undertaking not to enforce the judgment  for seven days, i.e., before the 30th June, 1975. On the 30th June, 1975, the Defendant applied to this Court for a  stay of execution of the Order.

The Defendant had in the meantime effected a new  policy of insurance upon his life in substitution for the  original collateral security which had been the subject-mat  of what the learned Judge called the policy charge, which  had lapsed before the Plaintiff issued the Originating Summons for possession. The Court of Appeal granted a stay on the  Defendant's undertaking to keep the new policy on foot. The premium under that policy was £399 a month.  The Defendant made default in paying the premium which fell due on the 1st October, 1975, and again defaulted on the 1st November, 1975. The new policy lapsed on the 1st November, 1975. Consequently, on the 10th November, 1975, the Plaintiff applied for the removal of the stay. This Court made no Order on that application, but expedited the appeal. It came on for hearing on the 17th November, 1975, and was heard on that and the following day, but there was not then enough time to complete the argument. Unfortunately, for reasons which I need not go into, it was not found possible to continue the case until the 2nd February, 1976. In the meantime, as I shall explain later, certain further information became available to the Plaintiff.

The Judge held that the mortgage superseded the loan contract and that accordingly the obligation of the mortgagor as to payment of interest was to be ascertained from the mortgage alone. Upon the construction of the mortgage he held that the mortgagor was under no obligation to pay any interest until the contractual date for repayment of the principal sum, namely the 4th January 1983, when interest would be payable as from the date of the loan.  In fact three instalments of interest have been paid, but thereafter the Defendant made no further payments of interest. Upon the Judge's finding he was under no obligation to do so. This has not been disputed on this appeal.

The Judge then considered the Plaintiff's right to possession in these circumstances. It was common ground before him, as it has been in this Court, that a legal mortgagee, which the Plaintiff is, has a right to possession at any time, irrespective of default on the mortgagor's part, unless the parties have agreed otherwise: see Four-Maids Limited v. Dudley Marshall (Properties) Limited, 1957 Chancery, 317. Before Mr Justice Goulding the argument turned on the effect of the Administration of Justice Act, 1970, Section 36.  It was not suggested "below that the parties had restricted the mortgagee's right to possession "by any contractual term. The learned Judge concluded that the section applied and in the exercise of his discretion he declined to assist the Defendant except to the very limited extent indicated by the Order. In this Court Mr Lightman has taken a new point, viz., that a term should "be implied in the mortgage that the mortgagee should not be entitled to possession except on a default under the mortgage by the mortgagor. He points out that taking possession has been said to amount to a demand for payment (Boville v. Endle, 1896 1 Chancery, 648, at 651) and that to permit this would conflict with the term of the mortgage providing for payment on the 4th January, 1983. Moreover, Mr Lightman contends that, since clause 4(A) of the mortgage stipulates that the statutory powers of sale and of appointing a receiver shall only be exercisable in the events there stated, which include failure to make payment in full on the date for the payment, the right to take possession, which he says is a lesser remedy, must by implication be similarly restricted.

Mr Bromley for the Plaintiff has objected to this new point being taken. He says on the authority of Friend v. Simmonds, 1971 1 Weekly Law Reports, 1381, that the mortgage must be construed in the light of the factual background known to the parties at the time of its execution and of its genesis and purpose objectively viewed, aspects to which, he says, the evidence has not been fully directed or deployed. We have, however, heard able arguments on the new point and I am prepared to treat it as open to the appellant, whether it is strictly so or not. In my judgment, there is no ground in this case for implying the suggested term. A legal mortgagee's right to possession is a common law right which is an incident of his estate in the land. It should not, in my opinion, be lightly treated as abrogated or restricted. Although it is perhaps most commonly exercised as a preliminary step to an exercise of the mortgagee's power of sale, so that the sale may be made with vacant possession, this is not its only value to the mortgagee. The mortgagee may wish to protect his security: (see Ex parte Wickens, 1898 1 Queen's Bench, 543, at 547 and 549). If for instance, the mortgagor were to vacate the property, the mortgagee might wish to take possession to protect the place from vandalism. He might wish to take possession for the purpose of carrying out repairs or to prevent waste. Where the contractual date for repayment is so unusually long delayed as it was in this case, a power of this nature to protect his security might well be regarded as of particular value to the mortgagee. Mr Lightman has argued that a term excluding the right of a mortgagee to enter into possession should normally be implied if and for so long as the terms of the mortgage preclude the mortgagee from making immediate demand for payment or otherwise immediately enforcing his security. He drew our attention to Esso Petroleum Company Limited v. Alstonbridge Properties Limited, 1975 1 Weekly Law Reports, 1474, and in particular to what was said by Mr Justice Walton at pages 1483 and 1484.  The learned Judge there said that he accepted that the Court would be ready to find such an implied term in an instalment mortgage, but that there must be something in the mortgage upon which to hang such a conclusion other than the mere fact that it is an instalment mortgage. In other words, he accepted that the fact that the mortgage was an instalment mortgage might make the inference easier to draw but would not in itself be a sufficient ground. With this I am disposed to agree. In my judgment, the proposition in the wide form in which Mr Lightman propounds it cannot be accepted. The conventional form of mortgage invariably fixes a contractual redemption date at some time in the future -very often six months after the date of the mortgage. An instalment mortgage ex hypothesi postpones payment of the instalments to dates after the date of the mortgage.  If Mr Lightman were right in his submission, in none of these cases could the mortgagee be entitled to demand possession immediately after the execution of the mortgage, and yet by common consent that is his right at law, graphically described by Mr Justice Harman in the Four-Maids case as a right to go into possession before the ink is dry on the mortgage.

Taking possession may be tantamount to demanding payment in the context of the question whether the mortgagee can thereafter insist on notice to redeem, which was the question in Boville v. Endle. It would be an obvious inequity if the mortgagor could be turned out without an immediate right to resist this or to recover possession by redemption. By way of contrast, for reasons already indicated, a right to possession does not seem to me to be inconsistent with a postponed redemption date, particularly when that date is long postponed; and I see no equitable grounds for thinking that such a right would bear unfairly on the mortgagor if, as in this case, possession cannot be used as a mere stepping stone to a sale with vacant possession unless and until some event has occurred which makes the power of sale available to the mortgagee. Until such event occurs, the right to possession can only be exorcised to protect the security, not as a means of enforcing it. As soon as his power of sale becomes available to him, the mortgagee should certainly be free to exercise his right to possession unless he has most clearly bound himself not to do so.  In the present case the availability of the power of sale does not depend only upon some default under the mortgage.  It could arise upon any one of a number of contingencies (see clause 4(A) of the mortgage) outside the mortgagor's control which could happen at any time before the contractual date for redemption.

We were referred to what was said by Lord Pearson in Trollope v. North West Metropolitan Hospital Board, 1973 1 Weekly Law Reports, 601, at 609, on the law relating to implied terms.  In my judgment, it is impossible to find in the mortgage in this case any indications possessing the required degree of certainty which would justify us in implying any term in the mortgage restricting the Plaintiff's right to possession. On the contrary, the presence in the mortgage of clause 4(A), in my opinion, points the other way on the basis of the principle expressio unius exclusio alterius. Accordingly, I reject this contention.

The Administration of Justice Act, 1970, Section 36, provides as follows:  "(1) Where the mortgagee under a mortgage of land which consists of or includes a dwelling-house brings an action in which he claims possession of the mortgaged property, not being an action for foreclosure in which a claim for possession of the mortgaged property is also made, the court may exercise any of the powers conferred on it by subsection (2) below if it appears to the court that in the event of its exercising the power the mortgagor is likely to be able within a reasonable period to pay any sums due under the mortgage or to remedy a default consisting of a breach of any other obligation arising under or by virtue of the mortgage.  (2) The court - (a) may adjourn the proceedings, or (b) on giving judgment, or making an order, for delivery of possession of the mortgaged property, or at any time before the execution of such judgment or order, may - (i) stay or suspend execution of the judgment or order, or (ii) postpone the date for delivery of possession, for such period or periods as the court thinks reasonable.  (3) Any such adjournment, stay, suspension or postponement as is referred to in subsection (2) above may be made subject to such conditions with regard to payment by the mortgagor of any sum secured by the mortgage or the remedying of any default as the court thinks fit.  (4) The court may from time to time vary or revoke any condition imposed by virtue of this section".

Mr Justice Goulding held that this section applied in the present case, and that he accordingly had a discretion to allow the Plaintiff to exercise its common law right to possession or to postpone the exercise of that right. Mr Lightman, on the other hand, contends that, the mortgagor not being in default, the Court is by implication positively required by that section to prevent the Plaintiff from taking possession, since the only relevant considerations are the existence of some default and its likelihood of being remedied. Alternatively he submits that by inference the section abrogates a mortgagee's right to possession except when some sum is due under the mortgage or the mortgagor is guilty of some other default under the mortgage.

In the present case, notwithstanding the loan contract, the mortgage and the policy charge must be treated as independent transactions. It is not disputed that the failure of the mortgagor to keep up the original policy, although it was of course a default under the policy charge, was not a default under the mortgage. So, on the evidence before the learned Judge, there was no sum due and no outstanding default under the mortgage.

I have been very much puzzled during the argument about the proper interpretation of Section 36. If subsection (1) is read literally, the conditional clause introduced by the words "if it appears to the court" (which I shall refer to as "the conditional clause") appears to restrict the operation of the section to cases in which some sum is due or some default has taken place and remains unremedied when the application comes before the Court. This, however, seems to me to lead to a ridiculous result. If a mortgagee applies to the Court for a possession Order while the mortgagor is in default, the Court may keep the matter in abeyance under subsection (2) for a reasonable period to permit the mortgagor to remedy the default: the mortgagor may do so within the time afforded to him by the Court: upon the construction of the section now under consideration, if there were no other subsisting default, the mortgagee could thereupon seek an immediate possession Order which the Court would have no power to refuse or to delay, "because no sum would then remain due and there would "be no outstanding default. A defaulting mortgagor would therefore he in a better position than one not in default. He could obtain a respite and, having done so, it would be in his interest to remain in default until the last moment of the period of respite.  I cannot believe that Parliament can have intended this irrational and unfair result. I must therefore investigate whether the section is capable of some other construction.

Mr Lightman, in the course of his ingenious and helpful argument, has suggested that Section 36 by inference abrogates a mortgagee's right to possession when there is no sum due and no subsisting default on the part of the mortgagor under the mortgage. I feel unable to accept this suggestion. Section 36 is an enabling section which empowers the Court to inhibit the mortgagee's right to take possession. It confers a discretionary power on the Court to achieve this result. It is, in my Judgment, impossible to spell out of it a positive abrogation of an important property right, and, moreover, an abrogation of it only in particular circumstances.

I think, however, that the section is capable of interpretation in a way which makes it applicable to a case in which a mortgagee seeks possession when no sum is duo and no other default is subsisting under the mortgage. I can see no reason why the legislature should confer the discretionary power on the Court when the mortgagor is in default, but should not do so when he is not in default. The manifest unfairness, as I think, of such a position seems to me a strong ground for "believing that it must have been Parliament's intention to confer the power, default or no default, notwithstanding the ineptness of the language of the section to achieve this result. The only part of the section which appears to contradict such an intention is the conditional clause. This can only apply when the mortgagor is in arrear with some payment or is otherwise in default.  It would be very natural for Parliament to provide that, where the mortgagor is in arrear or otherwise in default, the discretionary power should not be used to prevent the mortgagee from taking immediate possession unless the Court were satisfied that there was a genuine likelihood of the mortgagor being able to put himself right within a reasonable time. On this approach, the conditional clause operates as a restriction on the Court's free exercise of discretion. This would have been clear, had the conditional clause been framed in some such terms as these: 

"but, if any sum is due under the mortgage or the mortgagor is in default in respect of any other obligation arising under or by virtue of the mortgage, only if it appears to the court that in the event of its exercising the power the mortgagor is likely to be able within a reasonable period to pay any such sum or to remedy any such default". 

Although the language of the section is certainly inartistic to achieve this result and interpreting it in this way may involve some violence to the language (not, in my view, very great), nevertheless I think that, when the section is read as a whole in the context of the subject-matter and particularly having regard to the arbitrary unfairness of the literal construction, it is possible to spell this meaning out of the words used. Since I do not think that this Court should attribute to Parliament so irrational an intention as the literal construction would involve, I feel justified in adopting, and, in my judgment, we should adopt, the more liberal construction. Accordingly, in my judgment, on the true construction of the section, it applies to any case in which a mortgagee seeks possession, whether the mortgagor be in arrear or otherwise in default under the mortgage or not, but, where the mortgagor is in arrear or in default, the discretion is limited by the conditional clause.

For construing the section in this way I place reliance upon what was said by Lord Reid in Luke v. Inland Revenue Commissioners, 1963 Appeal Cases, 557, at 577: 

"To apply the words literally is to defeat the obvious intention of the legislature and to produce a wholly unreasonable result. To achieve the obvious intention and produce a reasonable result we must do some violence to the words. This is not a new problem, though our standard of drafting is such that it rarely emerges. The general principle is well settled. It is only where the words are absolutely incapable of a construction which will accord with the apparent intention of the provision and will avoid the wholly unreasonable result that the words of the enactment must prevail". 

The point was well put by Mr Justice Ungoed-Thomas in Re Maryon-Wilson's Will Trusts, 1968 Chancery, 268, at 282, where he said: 

"If the court is to avoid a statutory result that flouts common sense and justice it must do so not by disregarding the statute or overriding it, but by interpreting it in accordance with the judicially presumed Parliamentary concern for common sense and justice". 

In my judgment, the language of Section 36(1) is not incapable of bearing the construction which I favour, and consequently I adopt it as according with what I conceive to have been the true intention of Parliament.

Under Section 36(2), the Court can hold the matter in abeyance for a "reasonable period". I was at one stage of the argument impressed by the view that the word "reasonable" here related back to the conditional clause in subsection (1), and that this indicated that the discretion was one designed to be exercised only in cases falling within the conditional clause. On consideration, I have reached the conclusion that this is not so. When the mortgagor is in arrear or otherwise in default, a reasonable time for the purpose of subsection (2) must, I think, be measured by what is reasonable for the purposes indicated in the conditional clause in subsection (1). Where the mortgagor is not in arrear or in default, the Court will, upon the construction of the section which I favour, be at large in deciding what is reasonable for the purposes of subsection (2). I see nothing unlikely in supposing that Parliament meant this to be so. What would be reasonable must depend upon the circumstances of the case. Ihis may involve, amongst other things, considering why the mortgagee is anxious to obtain possession and what degree of urgency may exist in relation to any particular aspect of the case. It might, perhaps, also involve consideration of whether the mortgagor is likely to be able to pay sums accruing due from time to time under the mortgage punctually as and when they should become due.

In Royal Trust Co. v. Markham, 1975 1 Weekly Law Reports, 1416, this Court expressed the opinion that an adjournment, suspension or postponement under Section 36 must "be for a defined or ascertainable period. The Court was not then concerned with how the section might; operate in a case in which there was no sum due or other subsisting default under the mortgage.  If on the true interpretation of the section the period must he defined or ascertainable, the Court might, if it thought it reasonable to do so, keep control of the matter by holding it in abeyance for a specified period with liberty to apply in the meantime, and reconsider the situation at the end of that period or upon an earlier application by either party. In a suitable case the specified period might even be the whole remaining prospective life of the mortgage. I would not myself dissent from the view that the Court could, if it thought it reasonable to do so, grant an adjournment, suspension or postponement for an indefinite period (e.g. until further Order) with liberty for either party to apply. If the discretion can be regarded as being as wide as this, as in my opinion it can, I see no reason why the Court should not be able to decide what period is reasonable in any particular case.

I appreciate that to construe Section 36 in this way is in effect no convert the mortgagee's right to possession, which at common law is an absolute right, into a right which is exercisable only with the permission of the Court on good cause being shown.  I do not, however, regard this as a surprising result of a statutory provision which on any view is aimed at preventing an arbitrary use by the mortgagee of his legal right. It is a construction which, in my opinion, is to be preferred to holding that Parliament has either (1) sub silentio abrogated the mortgagee's right to possession, except when the mortgagor is in arrear or otherwise in default under the mortgage, by a section which in terms only confers a discretionary judicial power to control the exercise of that right, or (2) produced an irrational and unfair position by overlooking or misunderstanding the character of the mortgagee's right to possession at common law and consequently enacting the section in a form which leaves a lacuna which defeats the purpose of the section.

I think, therefore, that the Judge was right in holding that the section applied in the present case and that it conferred a discretion upon him. In the exercise of that discretion I think he was entitled to take into account all relevant surrounding circumstances and was not confined to consideration of matters directly arising out of the mortgage. In particular he was, in my opinion, fully entitled to take into account that as a result of the failure of the collateral security provided "by the policy charge the debt is now almost certainly inadequately secured.  In my judgment, the learned Judge was entitled to make the Order which he did upon the grounds which he stated. I would therefore dismiss this appeal.

When the argument was resumed in this Court on the 2nd February, Mr Bromley asked leave to adduce new evidence of facts which had come to the Plaintiff's knowledge only since the 18th November, when the appeal was last previously before us. We gave leave and permitted Mr Lightman to call the Defendant to give oral evidence in answer. This new evidence indicates that an execution was levied against the Defendant in the Southampton County Court in April, 1974, and that since the learned Judge gave Judgment a further execution was issued against the Defendant in the High Court in October, 1975. The Defendant denied any knowledge of these executions and insisted that his Solicitors had no authority to submit to judgment in the High Court action as they did.

Under clause 4(A)(iv) of the mortgage the statutory power of sale becomes exercisable upon an execution being issued against the Defendant "so that the whole monies hereby secured shall notwithstanding anything herein contained be deemed to become due immediately upon the execution hereof". So, if an execution was in fact levied against the Defendant in April, 1974, the statutory power of sale then became exercisable upon that footing. I do not regard the suffering of an execution as constituting a default under the mortgage, nor do I think that the effect of the sub-clause is to render the mortgage monies actually due; but the issue of an execution would have, in my judgment, a most important bearing upon the exercise of the discretion under Section 36, assuming that section to be applicable hero. Once the power of sale has become exercisable, the right to possession must be regarded as an adjunct of the greatest importance.  Very cogent reasons would, I think, be required in these circumstances to justify the Court in refusing the mortgagee an unrestricted right to possession. But, having regard to the very late stage at which this evidence was admitted and to the fact that the Defendant has not had a satisfactory opportunity of answering it, I think it would be wrong if this appeal should be decided upon the basis of this new evidence. Accordingly, I do not found my decision upon it.

I would dismiss this appeal and allow the Order for possession to take effect. I should be disposed to allow the Defendant 14 days from today for the purpose of moving out, but I would be prepared to hear any submissions that Counsel might now wish to make in this respect. 

LORD JUSTICE SCARMAN:  I agree.  This is an appeal by the mortgagor of a dwelling-house against an Order for possession within 28 days made by Mr Justice Goulding in an action brought by the mortgagee. Owing to the strange but absolutely clear terms of the legal charge, the mortgagee was driven to base his claim for possession on the common law right which he enjoys by virtue of his legal estate: for he could allege no default, no arrears. Mr Lightman, for the mortgagor, has put forward the case that, in the absence of a default by the mortgagor upon an obligation under the charge, or of arrears owed by him, the mortgagee has no right to possession; alternatively, that, if he has, the Court has a discretion to postpone an Order under Section 36 of the Administration of Justice Act, 1970, and should have exercised its discretion in favour of the mortgagor.

Mr Lightman's argument for the appellant - presented, if I may respectfully say so, forcefully and cogently - falls into two parts. First, he submits that there should be implied into the terms of the legal charge a further term excluding the mortgagor's right to possession in the absence of arrears or default by the mortgagor. It is, he contends, a mortgage under which the mortgagee has expressly agreed to wait ten years for repayment of his capital and for payment of interest (which, though it accrues from year to year, is not payable under this instrument until the date of repayment of capital): it is, therefore, - he argues - consistent with the tenor of the parties' agreement to imply a term excluding the mortgagee's right to possession at least until that date, unless, of course, the mortgagor has defaulted upon any of his obligations. And there has been no such default. The second part of his argument raises an important question. He submits that, upon its true construction, Section 36(1) of the Administration of Justice Act, 1970, (which applies only to mortgages of dwelling-houses) excludes the common law right of the mortgagee to possession irrespective of default or arrears - a right which, in the absence of an agreement excluding it, a mortgagee enjoys by virtue of his estate: see Fisher and Lightwood, Law of Mortgage, 8th Edition, page 269.

If this construction of the subsection be not possible, he submits in the alternative that the subsection confers power upon the Court by adjournment, or otherwise as specified in subsection (2), to delay the making or enforcement of an Order for possession not only in cases of default or arrears, where the subsection expressly applies, but also in the case, not expressly mentioned in the subsection, where a mortgagee is relying on his common law right alone.

Mr Lightman argues that, unless one or other of these constructions is placed upon the subsection, the section fails to provide the mortgagor of a dwelling-house with the protection against eviction which Parliament plainly intended him to have.

I now deal with the argument based on contract. I do not think it possible to imply into this legal charge a term excluding the mortgagee's common law right to possession. The right was, until recently, rarely exercised  perhaps because a mortgagee in possession is strictly controlled and accountable: see Fisher and Lightwood, supra, pages 293-294-. Since, at any rate until recently, no-one expected that a mortgagee would wish to take possession in the absence of a default or arrears or some event conferring upon him a power of sale, mortgagors, or their advisers, appear not to have been concerned to seek by agreement the exclusion of the right. General practice does not;, therefore, really support the implication for which he contends. But there is a more specific reason against this implication. Mr Lightman's contention that the postponement in this mortgage of the date of repayment for ten years shows that the mortgagee, in the absence of default, could not have intended to retain the right to re-enter is, in my judgment, the precise opposite of what a detached by-stander would expect. A mortgagee is concerned to preserve the value of his security. When, as in this case, he cannot recover capital or interest for a period of ten years, the preservation of the value of his security during that period is of vital importance to him. If the mortgagee should think that the mortgagor, either by absence from the property or by his standards of management, care and maintenance (which, without amounting to waste or breach of covenant, may yet not be as high as the mortgagee thinks desirable), is not doing all he, the mortgagee, would wish to see done, his common law right of possession is a valuable instrument of self-help. The present case is a good illustration.  The loan, made on the 4th January 1973, was of £32,000. A conservative estimate - more likely it is an under-estimate - of the rate of interest is 10 per cent per annum, i.e. £3,200 a year.  In ten years time, therefore, the debt owed to the mortgagee will be, in purely financial terms, doubled. So far from implying a term excluding the common law right, I would expect, as a matter of business efficacy, that the mortgagee would in these circumstances require its retention.  I am, therefore, unable to accept the appellant's argument based on contract.

I now turn to the argument based on statute. One may suppose that the section was passed to protect the mortgagors of dwelling-houses from the full rigour of the decision in the Four-Maids case and Birmingham Citizens Permanent Building Society v. Gaunt, (1962) 1 Chancery, 883. If the section neither abrogates the common law right nor subjects it to the power of delay admittedly conferred upon the Court in cases of default or arrears, the section fails in its purpose.  The critical subsections are (1) and (2): "(1) Where the mortgagee under a mortgage of land which consists of or includes a dwelling-house brings an action in which he claims possession of the mortgaged property, not being an action for foreclosure in which a claim for possession of the mortgaged property is also made, the court may exercise any of the powers conferred on it by subsection (2) below if it appears to the court that in the event of its exercising the power the mortgagor is likely to be able within a reasonable period to pay any sums due under the mortgage or to remedy a default consisting of a breach of any other obligation arising under or by virtue of the mortgage. (2) The court - (a) may adjourn the proceedings, or (b) on giving Judgment, or making an order, for delivery of possession of the mortgaged property, or at any time before the execution of such judgment or order, may - (i) stay or suspend execution of the judgment or order, or (ii) postpone the date for delivery of possession, for such period or periods as the court thinks reasonable".

Upon a first reading of these two subsections, I confess I thought it obvious that the powers conferred upon the Court are exercisable only if it appears to the Court that the mortgagor will be able within a reasonable time to pay off the arrears or remedy his default. In other words, there must be a default or arrears before the Court can intervene. I thought so not only because of the wording of subsection (1) but because the powers of adjournment, suspension and postponement conferred by subsection (2) appear to be appropriate only to cases where there are arrears to be met or a default to be remedied. Subsection (2) does not, in terms, confer a power to adjourn generally or sine die, which is the sort of power needed to give effective protection against the unreasonable exercise of a mortgagee's common law right of possession, independent, as it is, of default or arrears. Mr Lightman has, however, convinced me that it would be making a nonsense of the law so to read the two subsections. It would mean that a mortgagee could be prevented from taking possession when there was a default or arrears, but could not be so prevented if there were neither default nor arrears. Parliament cannot have intended so foolish a result.

Three courses are open to the Court. The first is to treat the section as having a "casus omissus", which only Parliament can fill.  The second, and that for which Mr Lightman principally contends (since it would give him victory outright), is to treat the section as excluding the common law right to possession from mortgages of dwelling-houses. The third is to treat the section as giving the Court a discretion to delay making an Order in all cases where, upon whatever ground, a mortgagee is seeking possession of a mortgaged dwelling-house.

Judicial legislation is not an option open to an English Judge.  Our Courts are not required, as are, for instance, the Swiss Courts (see the Swiss Civil Code, Articles 1 and 2), to declare and insert into legislation rules which the Judge would have put there, had he "been the legislator. But our Courts do have the duty of giving effect to the intention of Parliament, if it be possible, even though the process requires a strained construction of the language used or the insertion of some words in order to do so: see Luke v. Inland Revenue Commissioners, (1963) Appeal Cases, 557, per Lord Reid at page 577. The line between judicial legislation, which our law does not permit, and judicial interpretation in a way best designed to give effect to the intention of Parliament is not an easy one to draw. Suffice it to say that before our Courts can imply words into a statute the statutory intention must be plain and the insertion not too big, or too much at variance with the language in fact used by the legislature. The Courts will strain against having to take the first of the three courses I mentioned; that is to say, leaving unfilled the "casus omissus". In the case of this section, is there an acceptable reading which would enable us to give effect to Parliament's intention within the principle which I think governs the problem?

It would be going too far, in my judgment, to adopt the second course. It would, indeed, be judicial legislation to read a section conferring discretionary powers upon the Court as abrogating a common law right. I am not prepared to go that far in an attempt to make sense. If one had to go that far, then it would be for the legislature, not the Courts, to take the step.

If the second course is not open, can we adopt the third course? Though it is straining the language, I find no great difficulty in construing subsection (1) so that it confers a power of delay upon the Court in whatever circumstances the mortgagee of a dwelling-house is seeking to obtain possession. It entails reading the conditional clause in the subsection as applicable only where there are arrears or default, and not as cutting down the width of the power conferred. The greater difficulty, I think, is in the wording of subsection (2) which requires that the limit of a reasonable period be set upon the delaying power of the Court: see, for illustration, Royal Trust Co. of Canada v. Markham, reported in (1975) 1 Weekly Law Reports, 1416.  It is appropriate to set such a limit when the problem is whether the mortgagor can find the necessary money or remedy the default. Nevertheless, though it is difficult, it is not impossible to envisage circumstances in which it would be appropriate to impose a time limit upon a mortgagee seeking possession by virtue only of his common law right. The danger to the security, which would be the reason for the mortgagee's application, might appear less imminent to the Court than to the mortgagee; or the mortgagor might make proposals which the Court would think ought to be given a chance. In either case it could be appropriate to adjourn proceedings for a period in order to see whether the mortgagee's fears were justified. For myself, I doubt whether the subsection empowers the Court to adjourn a mortgagee's proceedings sine die or generally. But, upon the assumption that it does not, there is still sense, for the reasons given, in applying subsection (2) to cases where the mortgagee relies only on his estate and alleges no arrears or default.

Accordingly, I think that, within the general principle, it is open to the Court to take the third course: and, in my opinion, the wording of the two subsections is not so difficult as to make it impossible to give effect to what was plainly the intention of Parliament, namely, to give the Courts power, in their discretion, to protect the mortgagor of a dwelling-house for a reasonable period against eviction by his mortgagee.  I would therefore hold that the section applies as well where the mortgagee asserts his common law right as where he relies on arrears or default. Upon whatever ground the mortgagee of a dwelling-house seeks possession, the Court has, in my judgment, the discretion conferred by the section.

It follows, therefore, that the Judge had the discretion which he believed he had. In ordering immediate or almost immediate possession, he cannot be shown to have exercised his discretion wrongly.  I am not impressed with Mr Lightman's ingenious argument that the risk to the security arises not from anything that has happened to the security but from the mortgagee's own acceptance of a date of repayment ten years ahead.

For these reasons, I would dismiss the appeal. 

LORD JUSTICE GOFF: At the trial in the Court below this case proceeded on the basis that no act or event within clause 4(A) of the legal charge had occurred, and there was no evidence to the contrary. When this appeal was opened the position was still the same, hut the case had to be adjourned and during the interval the Respondents discovered, or believed they had, that execution had issued even before the commencement of these proceedings on a County Court judgment against the Appellant, and subsequently also on a High Court judgment.

At the resumed hearing, the Respondents sought leave, which we granted, to adduce further affidavit evidence to prove those facts.  It was not however strictly proved, and although we gave the Appellant leave to deal with the position by giving evidence before us, he had little time to instruct his Counsel, and no access to any papers to which he might wish to refer.  This being so, my brethren and I are agreed that it would not be fair or safe to rely on the further evidence, and this appeal must be decided on the same basis of fact as that on which it was conducted below. That is, of course, without prejudice to anything the Respondents may be able to prove, and the consequences, in fresh proceedings, should they bring any, and without prejudice to any remedies they may seek to exercise on the footing of the execution as issued. To save repetition, this must be understood throughout this judgment whenever I say that no act or event within clause 4(A) has occurred.

It has for a very long time been established law that a mortgagee has a proprietary right at common law as owner of the legal estate to go into possession of the mortgaged property: see Coote on Mortgages, 9th Edition (published 1927), Volume 2, page 821.  This right has been unequivocally recognised in a number of modern cases: see, for example, Four-Maids Ltd. v. Dudley Marshall (Properties) Ltd., 1957 Chancery, 317, and Birmingham Citizens Permanent Building Society v. Caunt, 1962 1 Chancery, 883. It has nothing to do with default: see per Mr Justice Harman (as he then was) in the Four-Maids case at page 320. As he there expressed it, "The mortgagee may go into possession before the ink is dry on the mortgage unless there is something in the contract, express or by implication, whereby he has contracted himself out of that right".

This the Appellant accepts, and it is in any case incontrovertible. Prima facie, therefore, the Respondents were entitled to an Order for possession which the learned Judge granted, although in exercise of the discretion which he supposed himself to have under Section 36 of the Administration of Justice Act, 1970, he gave time to enable the Appellant to remedy his breaches of covenant in respect of the collateral security under the endowment policy. The concluding words of his judgment show that he thought that discretion would enable the Court ultimately to refuse possession if the harm done by the lapse of the policy could be substantially and permanently repaired, but otherwise to allow the Order for possession to be enforced.  For reasons which will appear later, I do not think he had any such discretion on the facts of this case.

I will return to that later, because the Appellant relies first upon a question on the construction of the legal charge, which is quite independent of Section 36.

The cases show that a mortgagee may contract out of his common law right to take possession and this, as has been observed, he may do by implication as well as expressly: see Four-Maids Ltd. v. Dudley Marshall (Properties) Ltd., supra. There is clearly no such provision expressed in this legal charge, but the Appellant argues that one ought to "be implied. Now, even if that be right, it must clearly "be only until the 4th January, 1983, or until the earlier happening of some act or event specified in clause 4(A), "but that would he sufficient to enable the Appellant to succeed on this appeal, no such act or event having occurred.

Ought then such implication to be made? The Appellant answers yes because, the Respondents having agreed subject to clause 4(A) to wait for their money until the 4th January, 1983, it would be harsh and unconscionable for them to place the Appellant in the position of being forced either to yield up possession of his house or to pay before, and indeed long before, that date. I am not at all sure that it can be said to be so on the facts of this case, since in considering whether conduct is harsh or unconscionable one must look at all the circumstances, not the least of which is the Appellant's lamentable performance with respect to his obligations under the collateral security.

I will, however, assume, without deciding, that it would be. Still that is not a ground for implying a term in the contract.  It is a straight claim to relief in equity, and immediately it brings the Appellant up against an insurmountable hurdle that, as Mr Justice Cross (as he then was) said in Braithwaite v. Winwood, I960 1 Weekly Law Reports, at page 1263, under "an ordinary mortgage where the legal estate in fee simple was given to the mortgagee the mortgagee could at once take possession if he wished to do so, and (this is the important point) the Court of Chancery would never grant an injunction restraining him from doing so. Of course the Court of Chancery had its own weapon which it used against a mortgagee who did take possession. He would have to account strictly for his receipts in any redemption proceedings; but equity never intervened by injunction to prevent the mortgagee exercising his legal right to take possession".

In the Four-Maids case (1957 Chancery at page 321) Mr Justice Harman, dealing with the 1936 practice direction concerning Rules of the Supreme Court, Order 55, rule 5A, said this:  

"I have always been of opinion, and I remain of that opinion, that this practice is limited to what are by far the most frequent forms of mortgages, those whereby the principal, as well as the interest, are repaid by the mortgagor by commuted weekly or quarterly sums, and whereby the mortgagee precludes himself, so long as those weekly or other periodical sums are punctually paid, from going into possession. That is the way most people occupy their houses nowadays. Building societies are not desirous of going into possession, nor would they do business if they were able to go into possession whenever they liked. The whole object of building societies is to maintain the householder in possession of his house so long as he pays the instalments to the society, and these practice directions are directed to that matter. But in an old-fashioned type of mortgage, such as that in the present case, none of those considerations applies at all. The mortgagee can go into possession whenever he chooses, whether there are arrears or not, whether there is default or not".  

It has been doubted whether he was right in limiting the practice note to instalment mortgages, but that does not matter for present purposes. The point is that these words might be read as if he thought that a term limiting the right to take possession must he implied from the mere fact of the mortgage being an instalment mortgage. I do not think, however, that can have been what he meant, and it would be inconsistent with the whole premise of his judgment that the right to take possession is independent of default. As that is so, an agreement not to exercise it cannot be implied from the mere fact that the payment is to be by instalments so that there is no default so long as the payments are kept up.

I agree, however, as Mr Justice Walton said in Esso Petroleum v. Alstonbridge Properties, 1975 1 Weekly Law Reports at page 1484, that the Court will be ready to find an implied term limiting the right to possession in an instalment mortgage.  In the passage cited from the judgment of Mr Justice Harman he drew a distinction between an instalment mortgage and what he described as "an old-fashioned type of mortgage". The present instance is certainly not an instalment mortgage, but I doubt whether it is an example of what his Lordship had in mind as an old-fashioned type. That would normally have a contractual date for legal redemption after a short interval, usually six months, not ten years. I think that in this dichotomy the present case may very possibly fall to be considered rather as an instalment mortgage, and perhaps a fortiori. Even so, however ready the Court may be to imply a term, still, as Mr Justice Walton also said in the Esso Petroleum case at page 1484, "there must be something upon which to hang such a conclusion".

What then, if anything, is there? Mr Lightman relied on clause 4(A), and I see nothing else which can possibly help him.  I did not understand the deferment of interest as well as principal to be relied upon save in support of the harsh and unconscionable argument, of which I have already disposed.  If, however, it were, I could not accept it.

The argument on clause 4(A) was that the Respondents having by that clause expressly agreed not to exercise the greater remedy of sale before the 4th January, 1983, save upon the happening of any of the acts or events there specified, it must be assumed that the lesser right of taking possession was similarly fettered. Indeed, he went so far as to suggest it might be a fortiori. In my judgment, however, that is a non sequitur.

I should point out that the clause deals also with the statutory power to appoint a Receiver, which is perhaps more akin to taking possession, but that was a power devised, and now implied by statute, to enable a mortgagee to get some of the advantages of taking possession without incurring liability to account on the footing of wilful default.

The parties may, of course, have failed to direct their minds to the question, or the Appellant, whilst insisting upon protection against the power of sale and the power of appointing a Receiver against which he otherwise would have no shield, may have been content to rely, so far as the right to take possession is concerned, upon the protection afforded by the equitable rule of accountability on the footing of wilful default, and it is interesting to note that the passage in Coote on Mortgages, 9th Edition, page 821, says this:  

"It was formerly usual to insert in mortgage deeds an express proviso to the effect that it should be lawful for the mortgagor to retain possession, and receive the rents and profits, until default in payment of the principal and interest on the day fixed. But such provisos, are now generally omitted, for, having regard to the disadvantages attending the position of a mortgagee in possession, and as, apparently, the entry will entitle the mortgagor to redeem at once without notice or interest in lieu of notice, it is generally considered that the risk of a mortgagee entering within the period before default can be made, which is usually six months from the date of the deed, is one which, in practice, it is not necessary to guard against". 

Again, the Respondents, whilst willing to qualify their statutory powers, may not have been willing to contract out of their common law right to take possession. Moreover, where, as here, there is a long postponement of the date for repayment, the Respondents might well visualise the need to take possession before that date and before the happening of any act or event within clause 4(A). Mr Lightman says they could protect themselves against the property being left vacant and suffering from vandalism or squatters by the mortgagor's liability for waste, but in my view that is not a sufficient answer. Taking possession may be a much better protection.

In short, it seems to me that clause 4(A) is at most neutral in this respect. It does not, in my judgment, show that obviousness or necessity which are required before a contractual term can be implied. Indeed, the argument may cut the other way. Clause 4(A) is dealing with statutory remedies. Taking possession is not a remedy but a right: see per Mr Justice Walton in the Esso Petroleum case at page 1484, line H. Accordingly, it may be said expressio unius exclusio alterius.

Finally, in this connection Mr Lightman argues that if the Respondents could take possession, they would be bound after paying outgoings to account, I suppose annually, to the Appellant for any surplus and, therefore, it would be a bootless exercise. In my judgment, however, that is not right. They could retain that surplus, and add it to their security, because a mortgagee in possession receives the rents and profits as owner, and it is only on redemption that he becomes liable to account. Indeed, subject always to that liability if and when the Appellant brings it home by redemption, the Respondents could, I conceive, occupy the property for their own use, for example by allowing one of their employees to live there rent-free. If equity could not stop a mortgagee from taking possession, and it is plain it could not, then it could not call on him to account save in a redemption action, but then it would impose not only liability on the footing of wilful default but also yearly rests. This conclusion appears to me to be plainly right on principle and see the extract from Professor Maitland's Lectures on Equity cited in Birmingham Citizens Permanent Building Society v. Caunt, 1962 1 Chancery at page 888. See also the passage cited from the judgment of Mr Justice Cross in Braithwaite v. Winwood, I960 1 Weekly Law Reports at page 1263, where he said 

"He would have to account strictly for his receipts in any redemption proceedings".

In my judgment, therefore, the suggested term cannot be implied, and this ground of appeal fails.

I turn to the alternative case for the Appellant which, he based on Section 36 of the Administration of Justice Act, 1970, and which may be summarised in the following propositions. First, that section applies where there is no money due and unpaid and no default consisting of a breach of any other obligation arising under or by virtue of the mortgage. Secondly, that the failure of the Appellant to keep up the original policy and the substituted policy, however much it might be a breach of his obligations under the assignment of the policy, was not a breach of any obligation arising under or by virtue of the mortgage, for the Respondents, for reasons good or bad, kept them separate. Thirdly, it follows on the Judge's construction of the mortgage, and on the basis on which this case has proceeded, as no act or event within clause 4(A) has occurred, that this is a case within the first proposition. Fourthly, that in such a case Section 36 either abrogates the mortgagee's common law right to take possession unless and until there be default in payment of money or a breach, of any other obligation under the mortgage, or the Court is bound to exercise its discretion in favour of the mortgagor, I suppose by granting an adjournment sine die.

In my judgment, the second proposition is right, and the third does follow, and the questions we have to decide are, therefore, whether the first, and either way of putting the fourth, be right, in which case the appeal must succeed, or whether both or either of the first and fourth propositions are wrong, in which case it fails.

In order to decide these questions, one must in my judgment consider first the purpose and effect of Section 36 in the case to which it indubitably applies, namely, where there is default either in payment of money or otherwise.

In my judgment, the words in subsection (1), to which my Lord has referred as the conditional clause, "if it appears to the court that in the event of its exercising the power the mortgagor is likely to be able within a reasonable period to pay any sums due under the mortgage or to remedy a default consisting of a breach of any other obligation arising under or by virtue of the mortgage", make it clear that the purpose of the section is to enable the Court in any of the ways specified in subsection (2) to grant a limited time, which may of course in a proper case be extended by a further exercise of the statutory powers, within which the mortgagor may put the matter right.

If that were in doubt, and in my view it is not, the legislature has itself removed the doubt by the Administration of Justice Act, 1973.  This was passed to remedy a defect in the earlier Act, under which in the case of an instalment mortgage with a provision that on default the whole should become due the Court could only grant relief on the terms that the mortgagor do pay off the whole principal sum and not merely the instalments in arrear. This remedial Act by its very nature emphasises the purpose of the earlier Act, but it goes further, because in Section 8, subsection (1), it actually describes the purpose of the 1970 Act in these terms: "under which a court has power to delay giving a mortgagee possession of the mortgaged property so as to allow the mortgagor a reasonable time to pay any sums due under the mortgage".

This being so, it is argued that the first proposition must be right, both because that is the natural meaning of the words of the section, and because if it be not so a mortgagor who is not in default will be in a worse position than one who is, and it is further argued that the fourth proposition must be right in one or other form, since otherwise the section produces a result which is preposterously absurd. If, so the argument runs, all the Court can do is to grant time to enable a mortgagor to pay what is due or to remedy any other default under the mortgage, and when that has been done the mortgagee is left with his absolute proprietary right to take possession, then, save where the money due is the whole amount under the mortgage and the case is not one within Section 8 of the 1973 Act, it is idle to grant the mortgagor time to pay the money or remedy the default.

I feel the force of these arguments, but I am not able to accede to them. I am satisfied that Section 36 of the 1970 Act cannot be held, as it were by a side wind, to have wholly abrogated the mortgagee's proprietary right to take possession, even when there is no default. This would not, I think, be applying the principle of liberal construction to avoid absurdity stated by Lord Reid in Luke v. Inland Revenue Commissioners, 1963 Appeal Cases at page 577, but disregarding the statute or overriding it, which, as Mr Justice Ungoed-Thomas pointed out in Re Maryon Wilson's Will Trusts, 1968 Chancery at page 282, and in my Judgment rightly pointed out, is what the Court is not allowed to do. Nor, in my judgment, by parity of reasoning, can it be said that the Court has a discretion but is bound to exercise it against the mortgagee where there is no money due or other default under the mortgage. Apart from the illogicality of saying that the Court has a discretion, but is bound to exercise it in a particular way, this would really come back to abrogating the right.

It seems to me that there are only two courses open to the Court; the one preferred by my brethren to construe the clause as conferring a discretion in all cases, reading the conditional clause merely as a qualification on that discretion in the case of unpaid money due or other default; the other to construe the section literally and face whatever anomalies or absurdities that produces. For my part, with all respect, I think the latter is the correct course. It is, in my judgment, inescapable that the result of their construction is that the section operates as a positive enactment disentitling the mortgagee to exercise his proprietary right to take possession save on showing some cause other than the mere existence of his right as legal owner. That is perhaps less startling than saying that the right is wholly abrogated save upon default, but in my view it comes very near to it. Further, I find it very difficult to see how this section can be held to give the Court power to adjourn, whether sine die or for a fixed period, where there is no money due which ought to be paid, or other default to be remedied, or by what criterion it could determine what should be a reasonable period. It is one thing to grant an adjournment to enable something specific to be done, such as is contemplated by the conditional clause. It is altogether different to grant an adjournment to see if some act, event or failure may occur which will entitle the mortgagee to exercise a right which at the time of the adjournment he does not possess, since ex hypothesi he is not entitled to exercise his proprietary right save on due cause "being shown.

On the other hand, the anomalies and absurdities said to flow from the literal construction may be more apparent than real, because of the equitable liability to account on the footing of wilful default. Where there has never been any default, or where the Court has allowed time for it to be remedied, which has been done, the mortgagee will not ordinarily be in a position to exercise any power of sale, and, therefore, will generally not wish to go on and got possession, unless indeed there is some reason apart from default in payment or other obligation, for example if the premises have been left vacant, in which case there is nothing anomalous, unjust or ridiculous in allowing him to do so.

It may be that the Legislature overlooked the fact that the mortgagee's right is not dependent on default, or, more probably I think, it was concerned only to give a defaulting mortgagor a chance to make good his default, leaving everything else, that is to say his position on doing so, and the case where there has been no default to the protection of the equitable doctrine of accountability which has sufficed well in the past.

Be that as it may, in my judgment, Section 36 does not apply where there is no money due, and no other default, and, therefore, this appeal fails. If that be wrong, however, then in my judgment the construction my brethren have adopted must be right, and in that case I respectfully entirely agree both with them and with the learned Judge below that it would not be right, in the circumstances of this case, to exercise the Court's discretion under Section 36 so as to grant any indulgence or further indulgence to the Appellant, and I respectfully agree with the Order my Lord has proposed.

Order:- Appeal dismissed with costs against the Appellant up to the date of his Legal Aid Certificate; costs of the appeal from the date of the Legal Aid certificate to be paid out of the Legal Aid Fund, that Order not to be proceeded upon for three weeks, to give the Law Society an opportunity to make representations. Possession to be given within 14 days. Legal Aid taxation for the Appellant. Leave to appeal to the House of Lords refused.

[
LORD JUSTICE BUCKLEY:  This is an appeal from a judgment of Mr Justice Goulding delivered on the 23rd May, 1975. The Order was not perfected until the 18th June, 1975, which date it hears. The Defendant was ordered to deliver possession of a dwellinghouse, 56 Queen's Gate Mews, Kensington, to the Plaintiff mortgagee on or before the 23rd June, 1975, allowing the Defendant one month from the date of judgment to get out. The facts of the case are very clearly set out in the judgment of the learned Judge and I do not propose to recapitulate them. On the 23rd May, 1975 the Defendant issued a summons asking for an extension of time to vacate the property. This came before the Master of the 11th June, 1975, when he stood the summons over for cross-examination of the Defendant to take place on the 23rd June, 1975. On the last mentioned date the Defendant applied to Mr Justice Goulding for a stay of the Order, pending an appeal. The appointment before the Master was consequently  vacated. The Judge made no Order upon the application for stay, the Plaintiff undertaking not to enforce the judgment  for seven days, i.e., before the 30th June, 1975. On the 30th June, 1975, the Defendant applied to this Court for a  stay of execution of the Order.

The Defendant had in the meantime effected a new  policy of insurance upon his life in substitution for the  original collateral security which had been the subject-mat  of what the learned Judge called the policy charge, which  had lapsed before the Plaintiff issued the Originating Summons for possession. The Court of Appeal granted a stay on the  Defendant's undertaking to keep the new policy on foot. The premium under that policy was £399 a month.  The Defendant made default in paying the premium which fell due on the 1st October, 1975, and again defaulted on the 1st November, 1975. The new policy lapsed on the 1st November, 1975. Consequently, on the 10th November, 1975, the Plaintiff applied for the removal of the stay. This Court made no Order on that application, but expedited the appeal. It came on for hearing on the 17th November, 1975, and was heard on that and the following day, but there was not then enough time to complete the argument. Unfortunately, for reasons which I need not go into, it was not found possible to continue the case until the 2nd February, 1976. In the meantime, as I shall explain later, certain further information became available to the Plaintiff.

The Judge held that the mortgage superseded the loan contract and that accordingly the obligation of the mortgagor as to payment of interest was to be ascertained from the mortgage alone. Upon the construction of the mortgage he held that the mortgagor was under no obligation to pay any interest until the contractual date for repayment of the principal sum, namely the 4th January 1983, when interest would be payable as from the date of the loan.  In fact three instalments of interest have been paid, but thereafter the Defendant made no further payments of interest. Upon the Judge's finding he was under no obligation to do so. This has not been disputed on this appeal.

The Judge then considered the Plaintiff's right to possession in these circumstances. It was common ground before him, as it has been in this Court, that a legal mortgagee, which the Plaintiff is, has a right to possession at any time, irrespective of default on the mortgagor's part, unless the parties have agreed otherwise: see Four-Maids Limited v. Dudley Marshall (Properties) Limited, 1957 Chancery, 317. Before Mr Justice Goulding the argument turned on the effect of the Administration of Justice Act, 1970, Section 36.  It was not suggested "below that the parties had restricted the mortgagee's right to possession "by any contractual term. The learned Judge concluded that the section applied and in the exercise of his discretion he declined to assist the Defendant except to the very limited extent indicated by the Order. In this Court Mr Lightman has taken a new point, viz., that a term should "be implied in the mortgage that the mortgagee should not be entitled to possession except on a default under the mortgage by the mortgagor. He points out that taking possession has been said to amount to a demand for payment (Boville v. Endle, 1896 1 Chancery, 648, at 651) and that to permit this would conflict with the term of the mortgage providing for payment on the 4th January, 1983. Moreover, Mr Lightman contends that, since clause 4(A) of the mortgage stipulates that the statutory powers of sale and of appointing a receiver shall only be exercisable in the events there stated, which include failure to make payment in full on the date for the payment, the right to take possession, which he says is a lesser remedy, must by implication be similarly restricted.

Mr Bromley for the Plaintiff has objected to this new point being taken. He says on the authority of Friend v. Simmonds, 1971 1 Weekly Law Reports, 1381, that the mortgage must be construed in the light of the factual background known to the parties at the time of its execution and of its genesis and purpose objectively viewed, aspects to which, he says, the evidence has not been fully directed or deployed. We have, however, heard able arguments on the new point and I am prepared to treat it as open to the appellant, whether it is strictly so or not. In my judgment, there is no ground in this case for implying the suggested term. A legal mortgagee's right to possession is a common law right which is an incident of his estate in the land. It should not, in my opinion, be lightly treated as abrogated or restricted. Although it is perhaps most commonly exercised as a preliminary step to an exercise of the mortgagee's power of sale, so that the sale may be made with vacant possession, this is not its only value to the mortgagee. The mortgagee may wish to protect his security: (see Ex parte Wickens, 1898 1 Queen's Bench, 543, at 547 and 549). If for instance, the mortgagor were to vacate the property, the mortgagee might wish to take possession to protect the place from vandalism. He might wish to take possession for the purpose of carrying out repairs or to prevent waste. Where the contractual date for repayment is so unusually long delayed as it was in this case, a power of this nature to protect his security might well be regarded as of particular value to the mortgagee. Mr Lightman has argued that a term excluding the right of a mortgagee to enter into possession should normally be implied if and for so long as the terms of the mortgage preclude the mortgagee from making immediate demand for payment or otherwise immediately enforcing his security. He drew our attention to Esso Petroleum Company Limited v. Alstonbridge Properties Limited, 1975 1 Weekly Law Reports, 1474, and in particular to what was said by Mr Justice Walton at pages 1483 and 1484.  The learned Judge there said that he accepted that the Court would be ready to find such an implied term in an instalment mortgage, but that there must be something in the mortgage upon which to hang such a conclusion other than the mere fact that it is an instalment mortgage. In other words, he accepted that the fact that the mortgage was an instalment mortgage might make the inference easier to draw but would not in itself be a sufficient ground. With this I am disposed to agree. In my judgment, the proposition in the wide form in which Mr Lightman propounds it cannot be accepted. The conventional form of mortgage invariably fixes a contractual redemption date at some time in the future -very often six months after the date of the mortgage. An instalment mortgage ex hypothesi postpones payment of the instalments to dates after the date of the mortgage.  If Mr Lightman were right in his submission, in none of these cases could the mortgagee be entitled to demand possession immediately after the execution of the mortgage, and yet by common consent that is his right at law, graphically described by Mr Justice Harman in the Four-Maids case as a right to go into possession before the ink is dry on the mortgage.

Taking possession may be tantamount to demanding payment in the context of the question whether the mortgagee can thereafter insist on notice to redeem, which was the question in Boville v. Endle. It would be an obvious inequity if the mortgagor could be turned out without an immediate right to resist this or to recover possession by redemption. By way of contrast, for reasons already indicated, a right to possession does not seem to me to be inconsistent with a postponed redemption date, particularly when that date is long postponed; and I see no equitable grounds for thinking that such a right would bear unfairly on the mortgagor if, as in this case, possession cannot be used as a mere stepping stone to a sale with vacant possession unless and until some event has occurred which makes the power of sale available to the mortgagee. Until such event occurs, the right to possession can only be exorcised to protect the security, not as a means of enforcing it. As soon as his power of sale becomes available to him, the mortgagee should certainly be free to exercise his right to possession unless he has most clearly bound himself not to do so.  In the present case the availability of the power of sale does not depend only upon some default under the mortgage.  It could arise upon any one of a number of contingencies (see clause 4(A) of the mortgage) outside the mortgagor's control which could happen at any time before the contractual date for redemption.

We were referred to what was said by Lord Pearson in Trollope v. North West Metropolitan Hospital Board, 1973 1 Weekly Law Reports, 601, at 609, on the law relating to implied terms.  In my judgment, it is impossible to find in the mortgage in this case any indications possessing the required degree of certainty which would justify us in implying any term in the mortgage restricting the Plaintiff's right to possession. On the contrary, the presence in the mortgage of clause 4(A), in my opinion, points the other way on the basis of the principle expressio unius exclusio alterius. Accordingly, I reject this contention.

The Administration of Justice Act, 1970, Section 36, provides as follows:  "(1) Where the mortgagee under a mortgage of land which consists of or includes a dwelling-house brings an action in which he claims possession of the mortgaged property, not being an action for foreclosure in which a claim for possession of the mortgaged property is also made, the court may exercise any of the powers conferred on it by subsection (2) below if it appears to the court that in the event of its exercising the power the mortgagor is likely to be able within a reasonable period to pay any sums due under the mortgage or to remedy a default consisting of a breach of any other obligation arising under or by virtue of the mortgage.  (2) The court - (a) may adjourn the proceedings, or (b) on giving judgment, or making an order, for delivery of possession of the mortgaged property, or at any time before the execution of such judgment or order, may - (i) stay or suspend execution of the judgment or order, or (ii) postpone the date for delivery of possession, for such period or periods as the court thinks reasonable.  (3) Any such adjournment, stay, suspension or postponement as is referred to in subsection (2) above may be made subject to such conditions with regard to payment by the mortgagor of any sum secured by the mortgage or the remedying of any default as the court thinks fit.  (4) The court may from time to time vary or revoke any condition imposed by virtue of this section".

Mr Justice Goulding held that this section applied in the present case, and that he accordingly had a discretion to allow the Plaintiff to exercise its common law right to possession or to postpone the exercise of that right. Mr Lightman, on the other hand, contends that, the mortgagor not being in default, the Court is by implication positively required by that section to prevent the Plaintiff from taking possession, since the only relevant considerations are the existence of some default and its likelihood of being remedied. Alternatively he submits that by inference the section abrogates a mortgagee's right to possession except when some sum is due under the mortgage or the mortgagor is guilty of some other default under the mortgage.

In the present case, notwithstanding the loan contract, the mortgage and the policy charge must be treated as independent transactions. It is not disputed that the failure of the mortgagor to keep up the original policy, although it was of course a default under the policy charge, was not a default under the mortgage. So, on the evidence before the learned Judge, there was no sum due and no outstanding default under the mortgage.

I have been very much puzzled during the argument about the proper interpretation of Section 36. If subsection (1) is read literally, the conditional clause introduced by the words "if it appears to the court" (which I shall refer to as "the conditional clause") appears to restrict the operation of the section to cases in which some sum is due or some default has taken place and remains unremedied when the application comes before the Court. This, however, seems to me to lead to a ridiculous result. If a mortgagee applies to the Court for a possession Order while the mortgagor is in default, the Court may keep the matter in abeyance under subsection (2) for a reasonable period to permit the mortgagor to remedy the default: the mortgagor may do so within the time afforded to him by the Court: upon the construction of the section now under consideration, if there were no other subsisting default, the mortgagee could thereupon seek an immediate possession Order which the Court would have no power to refuse or to delay, "because no sum would then remain due and there would "be no outstanding default. A defaulting mortgagor would therefore he in a better position than one not in default. He could obtain a respite and, having done so, it would be in his interest to remain in default until the last moment of the period of respite.  I cannot believe that Parliament can have intended this irrational and unfair result. I must therefore investigate whether the section is capable of some other construction.

Mr Lightman, in the course of his ingenious and helpful argument, has suggested that Section 36 by inference abrogates a mortgagee's right to possession when there is no sum due and no subsisting default on the part of the mortgagor under the mortgage. I feel unable to accept this suggestion. Section 36 is an enabling section which empowers the Court to inhibit the mortgagee's right to take possession. It confers a discretionary power on the Court to achieve this result. It is, in my Judgment, impossible to spell out of it a positive abrogation of an important property right, and, moreover, an abrogation of it only in particular circumstances.

I think, however, that the section is capable of interpretation in a way which makes it applicable to a case in which a mortgagee seeks possession when no sum is duo and no other default is subsisting under the mortgage. I can see no reason why the legislature should confer the discretionary power on the Court when the mortgagor is in default, but should not do so when he is not in default. The manifest unfairness, as I think, of such a position seems to me a strong ground for "believing that it must have been Parliament's intention to confer the power, default or no default, notwithstanding the ineptness of the language of the section to achieve this result. The only part of the section which appears to contradict such an intention is the conditional clause. This can only apply when the mortgagor is in arrear with some payment or is otherwise in default.  It would be very natural for Parliament to provide that, where the mortgagor is in arrear or otherwise in default, the discretionary power should not be used to prevent the mortgagee from taking immediate possession unless the Court were satisfied that there was a genuine likelihood of the mortgagor being able to put himself right within a reasonable time. On this approach, the conditional clause operates as a restriction on the Court's free exercise of discretion. This would have been clear, had the conditional clause been framed in some such terms as these: 

"but, if any sum is due under the mortgage or the mortgagor is in default in respect of any other obligation arising under or by virtue of the mortgage, only if it appears to the court that in the event of its exercising the power the mortgagor is likely to be able within a reasonable period to pay any such sum or to remedy any such default". 

Although the language of the section is certainly inartistic to achieve this result and interpreting it in this way may involve some violence to the language (not, in my view, very great), nevertheless I think that, when the section is read as a whole in the context of the subject-matter and particularly having regard to the arbitrary unfairness of the literal construction, it is possible to spell this meaning out of the words used. Since I do not think that this Court should attribute to Parliament so irrational an intention as the literal construction would involve, I feel justified in adopting, and, in my judgment, we should adopt, the more liberal construction. Accordingly, in my judgment, on the true construction of the section, it applies to any case in which a mortgagee seeks possession, whether the mortgagor be in arrear or otherwise in default under the mortgage or not, but, where the mortgagor is in arrear or in default, the discretion is limited by the conditional clause.

For construing the section in this way I place reliance upon what was said by Lord Reid in Luke v. Inland Revenue Commissioners, 1963 Appeal Cases, 557, at 577: 

"To apply the words literally is to defeat the obvious intention of the legislature and to produce a wholly unreasonable result. To achieve the obvious intention and produce a reasonable result we must do some violence to the words. This is not a new problem, though our standard of drafting is such that it rarely emerges. The general principle is well settled. It is only where the words are absolutely incapable of a construction which will accord with the apparent intention of the provision and will avoid the wholly unreasonable result that the words of the enactment must prevail". 

The point was well put by Mr Justice Ungoed-Thomas in Re Maryon-Wilson's Will Trusts, 1968 Chancery, 268, at 282, where he said: 

"If the court is to avoid a statutory result that flouts common sense and justice it must do so not by disregarding the statute or overriding it, but by interpreting it in accordance with the judicially presumed Parliamentary concern for common sense and justice". 

In my judgment, the language of Section 36(1) is not incapable of bearing the construction which I favour, and consequently I adopt it as according with what I conceive to have been the true intention of Parliament.

Under Section 36(2), the Court can hold the matter in abeyance for a "reasonable period". I was at one stage of the argument impressed by the view that the word "reasonable" here related back to the conditional clause in subsection (1), and that this indicated that the discretion was one designed to be exercised only in cases falling within the conditional clause. On consideration, I have reached the conclusion that this is not so. When the mortgagor is in arrear or otherwise in default, a reasonable time for the purpose of subsection (2) must, I think, be measured by what is reasonable for the purposes indicated in the conditional clause in subsection (1). Where the mortgagor is not in arrear or in default, the Court will, upon the construction of the section which I favour, be at large in deciding what is reasonable for the purposes of subsection (2). I see nothing unlikely in supposing that Parliament meant this to be so. What would be reasonable must depend upon the circumstances of the case. Ihis may involve, amongst other things, considering why the mortgagee is anxious to obtain possession and what degree of urgency may exist in relation to any particular aspect of the case. It might, perhaps, also involve consideration of whether the mortgagor is likely to be able to pay sums accruing due from time to time under the mortgage punctually as and when they should become due.

In Royal Trust Co. v. Markham, 1975 1 Weekly Law Reports, 1416, this Court expressed the opinion that an adjournment, suspension or postponement under Section 36 must "be for a defined or ascertainable period. The Court was not then concerned with how the section might; operate in a case in which there was no sum due or other subsisting default under the mortgage.  If on the true interpretation of the section the period must he defined or ascertainable, the Court might, if it thought it reasonable to do so, keep control of the matter by holding it in abeyance for a specified period with liberty to apply in the meantime, and reconsider the situation at the end of that period or upon an earlier application by either party. In a suitable case the specified period might even be the whole remaining prospective life of the mortgage. I would not myself dissent from the view that the Court could, if it thought it reasonable to do so, grant an adjournment, suspension or postponement for an indefinite period (e.g. until further Order) with liberty for either party to apply. If the discretion can be regarded as being as wide as this, as in my opinion it can, I see no reason why the Court should not be able to decide what period is reasonable in any particular case.

I appreciate that to construe Section 36 in this way is in effect no convert the mortgagee's right to possession, which at common law is an absolute right, into a right which is exercisable only with the permission of the Court on good cause being shown.  I do not, however, regard this as a surprising result of a statutory provision which on any view is aimed at preventing an arbitrary use by the mortgagee of his legal right. It is a construction which, in my opinion, is to be preferred to holding that Parliament has either (1) sub silentio abrogated the mortgagee's right to possession, except when the mortgagor is in arrear or otherwise in default under the mortgage, by a section which in terms only confers a discretionary judicial power to control the exercise of that right, or (2) produced an irrational and unfair position by overlooking or misunderstanding the character of the mortgagee's right to possession at common law and consequently enacting the section in a form which leaves a lacuna which defeats the purpose of the section.

I think, therefore, that the Judge was right in holding that the section applied in the present case and that it conferred a discretion upon him. In the exercise of that discretion I think he was entitled to take into account all relevant surrounding circumstances and was not confined to consideration of matters directly arising out of the mortgage. In particular he was, in my opinion, fully entitled to take into account that as a result of the failure of the collateral security provided "by the policy charge the debt is now almost certainly inadequately secured.  In my judgment, the learned Judge was entitled to make the Order which he did upon the grounds which he stated. I would therefore dismiss this appeal.

When the argument was resumed in this Court on the 2nd February, Mr Bromley asked leave to adduce new evidence of facts which had come to the Plaintiff's knowledge only since the 18th November, when the appeal was last previously before us. We gave leave and permitted Mr Lightman to call the Defendant to give oral evidence in answer. This new evidence indicates that an execution was levied against the Defendant in the Southampton County Court in April, 1974, and that since the learned Judge gave Judgment a further execution was issued against the Defendant in the High Court in October, 1975. The Defendant denied any knowledge of these executions and insisted that his Solicitors had no authority to submit to judgment in the High Court action as they did.

Under clause 4(A)(iv) of the mortgage the statutory power of sale becomes exercisable upon an execution being issued against the Defendant "so that the whole monies hereby secured shall notwithstanding anything herein contained be deemed to become due immediately upon the execution hereof". So, if an execution was in fact levied against the Defendant in April, 1974, the statutory power of sale then became exercisable upon that footing. I do not regard the suffering of an execution as constituting a default under the mortgage, nor do I think that the effect of the sub-clause is to render the mortgage monies actually due; but the issue of an execution would have, in my judgment, a most important bearing upon the exercise of the discretion under Section 36, assuming that section to be applicable hero. Once the power of sale has become exercisable, the right to possession must be regarded as an adjunct of the greatest importance.  Very cogent reasons would, I think, be required in these circumstances to justify the Court in refusing the mortgagee an unrestricted right to possession. But, having regard to the very late stage at which this evidence was admitted and to the fact that the Defendant has not had a satisfactory opportunity of answering it, I think it would be wrong if this appeal should be decided upon the basis of this new evidence. Accordingly, I do not found my decision upon it.

I would dismiss this appeal and allow the Order for possession to take effect. I should be disposed to allow the Defendant 14 days from today for the purpose of moving out, but I would be prepared to hear any submissions that Counsel might now wish to make in this respect. 

LORD JUSTICE SCARMAN:  I agree.  This is an appeal by the mortgagor of a dwelling-house against an Order for possession within 28 days made by Mr Justice Goulding in an action brought by the mortgagee. Owing to the strange but absolutely clear terms of the legal charge, the mortgagee was driven to base his claim for possession on the common law right which he enjoys by virtue of his legal estate: for he could allege no default, no arrears. Mr Lightman, for the mortgagor, has put forward the case that, in the absence of a default by the mortgagor upon an obligation under the charge, or of arrears owed by him, the mortgagee has no right to possession; alternatively, that, if he has, the Court has a discretion to postpone an Order under Section 36 of the Administration of Justice Act, 1970, and should have exercised its discretion in favour of the mortgagor.

Mr Lightman's argument for the appellant - presented, if I may respectfully say so, forcefully and cogently - falls into two parts. First, he submits that there should be implied into the terms of the legal charge a further term excluding the mortgagor's right to possession in the absence of arrears or default by the mortgagor. It is, he contends, a mortgage under which the mortgagee has expressly agreed to wait ten years for repayment of his capital and for payment of interest (which, though it accrues from year to year, is not payable under this instrument until the date of repayment of capital): it is, therefore, - he argues - consistent with the tenor of the parties' agreement to imply a term excluding the mortgagee's right to possession at least until that date, unless, of course, the mortgagor has defaulted upon any of his obligations. And there has been no such default. The second part of his argument raises an important question. He submits that, upon its true construction, Section 36(1) of the Administration of Justice Act, 1970, (which applies only to mortgages of dwelling-houses) excludes the common law right of the mortgagee to possession irrespective of default or arrears - a right which, in the absence of an agreement excluding it, a mortgagee enjoys by virtue of his estate: see Fisher and Lightwood, Law of Mortgage, 8th Edition, page 269.

If this construction of the subsection be not possible, he submits in the alternative that the subsection confers power upon the Court by adjournment, or otherwise as specified in subsection (2), to delay the making or enforcement of an Order for possession not only in cases of default or arrears, where the subsection expressly applies, but also in the case, not expressly mentioned in the subsection, where a mortgagee is relying on his common law right alone.

Mr Lightman argues that, unless one or other of these constructions is placed upon the subsection, the section fails to provide the mortgagor of a dwelling-house with the protection against eviction which Parliament plainly intended him to have.

I now deal with the argument based on contract. I do not think it possible to imply into this legal charge a term excluding the mortgagee's common law right to possession. The right was, until recently, rarely exercised  perhaps because a mortgagee in possession is strictly controlled and accountable: see Fisher and Lightwood, supra, pages 293-294-. Since, at any rate until recently, no-one expected that a mortgagee would wish to take possession in the absence of a default or arrears or some event conferring upon him a power of sale, mortgagors, or their advisers, appear not to have been concerned to seek by agreement the exclusion of the right. General practice does not;, therefore, really support the implication for which he contends. But there is a more specific reason against this implication. Mr Lightman's contention that the postponement in this mortgage of the date of repayment for ten years shows that the mortgagee, in the absence of default, could not have intended to retain the right to re-enter is, in my judgment, the precise opposite of what a detached by-stander would expect. A mortgagee is concerned to preserve the value of his security. When, as in this case, he cannot recover capital or interest for a period of ten years, the preservation of the value of his security during that period is of vital importance to him. If the mortgagee should think that the mortgagor, either by absence from the property or by his standards of management, care and maintenance (which, without amounting to waste or breach of covenant, may yet not be as high as the mortgagee thinks desirable), is not doing all he, the mortgagee, would wish to see done, his common law right of possession is a valuable instrument of self-help. The present case is a good illustration.  The loan, made on the 4th January 1973, was of £32,000. A conservative estimate - more likely it is an under-estimate - of the rate of interest is 10 per cent per annum, i.e. £3,200 a year.  In ten years time, therefore, the debt owed to the mortgagee will be, in purely financial terms, doubled. So far from implying a term excluding the common law right, I would expect, as a matter of business efficacy, that the mortgagee would in these circumstances require its retention.  I am, therefore, unable to accept the appellant's argument based on contract.

I now turn to the argument based on statute. One may suppose that the section was passed to protect the mortgagors of dwelling-houses from the full rigour of the decision in the Four-Maids case and Birmingham Citizens Permanent Building Society v. Gaunt, (1962) 1 Chancery, 883. If the section neither abrogates the common law right nor subjects it to the power of delay admittedly conferred upon the Court in cases of default or arrears, the section fails in its purpose.  The critical subsections are (1) and (2): "(1) Where the mortgagee under a mortgage of land which consists of or includes a dwelling-house brings an action in which he claims possession of the mortgaged property, not being an action for foreclosure in which a claim for possession of the mortgaged property is also made, the court may exercise any of the powers conferred on it by subsection (2) below if it appears to the court that in the event of its exercising the power the mortgagor is likely to be able within a reasonable period to pay any sums due under the mortgage or to remedy a default consisting of a breach of any other obligation arising under or by virtue of the mortgage. (2) The court - (a) may adjourn the proceedings, or (b) on giving Judgment, or making an order, for delivery of possession of the mortgaged property, or at any time before the execution of such judgment or order, may - (i) stay or suspend execution of the judgment or order, or (ii) postpone the date for delivery of possession, for such period or periods as the court thinks reasonable".

Upon a first reading of these two subsections, I confess I thought it obvious that the powers conferred upon the Court are exercisable only if it appears to the Court that the mortgagor will be able within a reasonable time to pay off the arrears or remedy his default. In other words, there must be a default or arrears before the Court can intervene. I thought so not only because of the wording of subsection (1) but because the powers of adjournment, suspension and postponement conferred by subsection (2) appear to be appropriate only to cases where there are arrears to be met or a default to be remedied. Subsection (2) does not, in terms, confer a power to adjourn generally or sine die, which is the sort of power needed to give effective protection against the unreasonable exercise of a mortgagee's common law right of possession, independent, as it is, of default or arrears. Mr Lightman has, however, convinced me that it would be making a nonsense of the law so to read the two subsections. It would mean that a mortgagee could be prevented from taking possession when there was a default or arrears, but could not be so prevented if there were neither default nor arrears. Parliament cannot have intended so foolish a result.

Three courses are open to the Court. The first is to treat the section as having a "casus omissus", which only Parliament can fill.  The second, and that for which Mr Lightman principally contends (since it would give him victory outright), is to treat the section as excluding the common law right to possession from mortgages of dwelling-houses. The third is to treat the section as giving the Court a discretion to delay making an Order in all cases where, upon whatever ground, a mortgagee is seeking possession of a mortgaged dwelling-house.

Judicial legislation is not an option open to an English Judge.  Our Courts are not required, as are, for instance, the Swiss Courts (see the Swiss Civil Code, Articles 1 and 2), to declare and insert into legislation rules which the Judge would have put there, had he "been the legislator. But our Courts do have the duty of giving effect to the intention of Parliament, if it be possible, even though the process requires a strained construction of the language used or the insertion of some words in order to do so: see Luke v. Inland Revenue Commissioners, (1963) Appeal Cases, 557, per Lord Reid at page 577. The line between judicial legislation, which our law does not permit, and judicial interpretation in a way best designed to give effect to the intention of Parliament is not an easy one to draw. Suffice it to say that before our Courts can imply words into a statute the statutory intention must be plain and the insertion not too big, or too much at variance with the language in fact used by the legislature. The Courts will strain against having to take the first of the three courses I mentioned; that is to say, leaving unfilled the "casus omissus". In the case of this section, is there an acceptable reading which would enable us to give effect to Parliament's intention within the principle which I think governs the problem?

It would be going too far, in my judgment, to adopt the second course. It would, indeed, be judicial legislation to read a section conferring discretionary powers upon the Court as abrogating a common law right. I am not prepared to go that far in an attempt to make sense. If one had to go that far, then it would be for the legislature, not the Courts, to take the step.

If the second course is not open, can we adopt the third course? Though it is straining the language, I find no great difficulty in construing subsection (1) so that it confers a power of delay upon the Court in whatever circumstances the mortgagee of a dwelling-house is seeking to obtain possession. It entails reading the conditional clause in the subsection as applicable only where there are arrears or default, and not as cutting down the width of the power conferred. The greater difficulty, I think, is in the wording of subsection (2) which requires that the limit of a reasonable period be set upon the delaying power of the Court: see, for illustration, Royal Trust Co. of Canada v. Markham, reported in (1975) 1 Weekly Law Reports, 1416.  It is appropriate to set such a limit when the problem is whether the mortgagor can find the necessary money or remedy the default. Nevertheless, though it is difficult, it is not impossible to envisage circumstances in which it would be appropriate to impose a time limit upon a mortgagee seeking possession by virtue only of his common law right. The danger to the security, which would be the reason for the mortgagee's application, might appear less imminent to the Court than to the mortgagee; or the mortgagor might make proposals which the Court would think ought to be given a chance. In either case it could be appropriate to adjourn proceedings for a period in order to see whether the mortgagee's fears were justified. For myself, I doubt whether the subsection empowers the Court to adjourn a mortgagee's proceedings sine die or generally. But, upon the assumption that it does not, there is still sense, for the reasons given, in applying subsection (2) to cases where the mortgagee relies only on his estate and alleges no arrears or default.

Accordingly, I think that, within the general principle, it is open to the Court to take the third course: and, in my opinion, the wording of the two subsections is not so difficult as to make it impossible to give effect to what was plainly the intention of Parliament, namely, to give the Courts power, in their discretion, to protect the mortgagor of a dwelling-house for a reasonable period against eviction by his mortgagee.  I would therefore hold that the section applies as well where the mortgagee asserts his common law right as where he relies on arrears or default. Upon whatever ground the mortgagee of a dwelling-house seeks possession, the Court has, in my judgment, the discretion conferred by the section.

It follows, therefore, that the Judge had the discretion which he believed he had. In ordering immediate or almost immediate possession, he cannot be shown to have exercised his discretion wrongly.  I am not impressed with Mr Lightman's ingenious argument that the risk to the security arises not from anything that has happened to the security but from the mortgagee's own acceptance of a date of repayment ten years ahead.

For these reasons, I would dismiss the appeal. 

LORD JUSTICE GOFF: At the trial in the Court below this case proceeded on the basis that no act or event within clause 4(A) of the legal charge had occurred, and there was no evidence to the contrary. When this appeal was opened the position was still the same, hut the case had to be adjourned and during the interval the Respondents discovered, or believed they had, that execution had issued even before the commencement of these proceedings on a County Court judgment against the Appellant, and subsequently also on a High Court judgment.

At the resumed hearing, the Respondents sought leave, which we granted, to adduce further affidavit evidence to prove those facts.  It was not however strictly proved, and although we gave the Appellant leave to deal with the position by giving evidence before us, he had little time to instruct his Counsel, and no access to any papers to which he might wish to refer.  This being so, my brethren and I are agreed that it would not be fair or safe to rely on the further evidence, and this appeal must be decided on the same basis of fact as that on which it was conducted below. That is, of course, without prejudice to anything the Respondents may be able to prove, and the consequences, in fresh proceedings, should they bring any, and without prejudice to any remedies they may seek to exercise on the footing of the execution as issued. To save repetition, this must be understood throughout this judgment whenever I say that no act or event within clause 4(A) has occurred.

It has for a very long time been established law that a mortgagee has a proprietary right at common law as owner of the legal estate to go into possession of the mortgaged property: see Coote on Mortgages, 9th Edition (published 1927), Volume 2, page 821.  This right has been unequivocally recognised in a number of modern cases: see, for example, Four-Maids Ltd. v. Dudley Marshall (Properties) Ltd., 1957 Chancery, 317, and Birmingham Citizens Permanent Building Society v. Caunt, 1962 1 Chancery, 883. It has nothing to do with default: see per Mr Justice Harman (as he then was) in the Four-Maids case at page 320. As he there expressed it, "The mortgagee may go into possession before the ink is dry on the mortgage unless there is something in the contract, express or by implication, whereby he has contracted himself out of that right".

This the Appellant accepts, and it is in any case incontrovertible. Prima facie, therefore, the Respondents were entitled to an Order for possession which the learned Judge granted, although in exercise of the discretion which he supposed himself to have under Section 36 of the Administration of Justice Act, 1970, he gave time to enable the Appellant to remedy his breaches of covenant in respect of the collateral security under the endowment policy. The concluding words of his judgment show that he thought that discretion would enable the Court ultimately to refuse possession if the harm done by the lapse of the policy could be substantially and permanently repaired, but otherwise to allow the Order for possession to be enforced.  For reasons which will appear later, I do not think he had any such discretion on the facts of this case.

I will return to that later, because the Appellant relies first upon a question on the construction of the legal charge, which is quite independent of Section 36.

The cases show that a mortgagee may contract out of his common law right to take possession and this, as has been observed, he may do by implication as well as expressly: see Four-Maids Ltd. v. Dudley Marshall (Properties) Ltd., supra. There is clearly no such provision expressed in this legal charge, but the Appellant argues that one ought to "be implied. Now, even if that be right, it must clearly "be only until the 4th January, 1983, or until the earlier happening of some act or event specified in clause 4(A), "but that would he sufficient to enable the Appellant to succeed on this appeal, no such act or event having occurred.

Ought then such implication to be made? The Appellant answers yes because, the Respondents having agreed subject to clause 4(A) to wait for their money until the 4th January, 1983, it would be harsh and unconscionable for them to place the Appellant in the position of being forced either to yield up possession of his house or to pay before, and indeed long before, that date. I am not at all sure that it can be said to be so on the facts of this case, since in considering whether conduct is harsh or unconscionable one must look at all the circumstances, not the least of which is the Appellant's lamentable performance with respect to his obligations under the collateral security.

I will, however, assume, without deciding, that it would be. Still that is not a ground for implying a term in the contract.  It is a straight claim to relief in equity, and immediately it brings the Appellant up against an insurmountable hurdle that, as Mr Justice Cross (as he then was) said in Braithwaite v. Winwood, I960 1 Weekly Law Reports, at page 1263, under "an ordinary mortgage where the legal estate in fee simple was given to the mortgagee the mortgagee could at once take possession if he wished to do so, and (this is the important point) the Court of Chancery would never grant an injunction restraining him from doing so. Of course the Court of Chancery had its own weapon which it used against a mortgagee who did take possession. He would have to account strictly for his receipts in any redemption proceedings; but equity never intervened by injunction to prevent the mortgagee exercising his legal right to take possession".

In the Four-Maids case (1957 Chancery at page 321) Mr Justice Harman, dealing with the 1936 practice direction concerning Rules of the Supreme Court, Order 55, rule 5A, said this:  

"I have always been of opinion, and I remain of that opinion, that this practice is limited to what are by far the most frequent forms of mortgages, those whereby the principal, as well as the interest, are repaid by the mortgagor by commuted weekly or quarterly sums, and whereby the mortgagee precludes himself, so long as those weekly or other periodical sums are punctually paid, from going into possession. That is the way most people occupy their houses nowadays. Building societies are not desirous of going into possession, nor would they do business if they were able to go into possession whenever they liked. The whole object of building societies is to maintain the householder in possession of his house so long as he pays the instalments to the society, and these practice directions are directed to that matter. But in an old-fashioned type of mortgage, such as that in the present case, none of those considerations applies at all. The mortgagee can go into possession whenever he chooses, whether there are arrears or not, whether there is default or not".  

It has been doubted whether he was right in limiting the practice note to instalment mortgages, but that does not matter for present purposes. The point is that these words might be read as if he thought that a term limiting the right to take possession must he implied from the mere fact of the mortgage being an instalment mortgage. I do not think, however, that can have been what he meant, and it would be inconsistent with the whole premise of his judgment that the right to take possession is independent of default. As that is so, an agreement not to exercise it cannot be implied from the mere fact that the payment is to be by instalments so that there is no default so long as the payments are kept up.

I agree, however, as Mr Justice Walton said in Esso Petroleum v. Alstonbridge Properties, 1975 1 Weekly Law Reports at page 1484, that the Court will be ready to find an implied term limiting the right to possession in an instalment mortgage.  In the passage cited from the judgment of Mr Justice Harman he drew a distinction between an instalment mortgage and what he described as "an old-fashioned type of mortgage". The present instance is certainly not an instalment mortgage, but I doubt whether it is an example of what his Lordship had in mind as an old-fashioned type. That would normally have a contractual date for legal redemption after a short interval, usually six months, not ten years. I think that in this dichotomy the present case may very possibly fall to be considered rather as an instalment mortgage, and perhaps a fortiori. Even so, however ready the Court may be to imply a term, still, as Mr Justice Walton also said in the Esso Petroleum case at page 1484, "there must be something upon which to hang such a conclusion".

What then, if anything, is there? Mr Lightman relied on clause 4(A), and I see nothing else which can possibly help him.  I did not understand the deferment of interest as well as principal to be relied upon save in support of the harsh and unconscionable argument, of which I have already disposed.  If, however, it were, I could not accept it.

The argument on clause 4(A) was that the Respondents having by that clause expressly agreed not to exercise the greater remedy of sale before the 4th January, 1983, save upon the happening of any of the acts or events there specified, it must be assumed that the lesser right of taking possession was similarly fettered. Indeed, he went so far as to suggest it might be a fortiori. In my judgment, however, that is a non sequitur.

I should point out that the clause deals also with the statutory power to appoint a Receiver, which is perhaps more akin to taking possession, but that was a power devised, and now implied by statute, to enable a mortgagee to get some of the advantages of taking possession without incurring liability to account on the footing of wilful default.

The parties may, of course, have failed to direct their minds to the question, or the Appellant, whilst insisting upon protection against the power of sale and the power of appointing a Receiver against which he otherwise would have no shield, may have been content to rely, so far as the right to take possession is concerned, upon the protection afforded by the equitable rule of accountability on the footing of wilful default, and it is interesting to note that the passage in Coote on Mortgages, 9th Edition, page 821, says this:  

"It was formerly usual to insert in mortgage deeds an express proviso to the effect that it should be lawful for the mortgagor to retain possession, and receive the rents and profits, until default in payment of the principal and interest on the day fixed. But such provisos, are now generally omitted, for, having regard to the disadvantages attending the position of a mortgagee in possession, and as, apparently, the entry will entitle the mortgagor to redeem at once without notice or interest in lieu of notice, it is generally considered that the risk of a mortgagee entering within the period before default can be made, which is usually six months from the date of the deed, is one which, in practice, it is not necessary to guard against". 

Again, the Respondents, whilst willing to qualify their statutory powers, may not have been willing to contract out of their common law right to take possession. Moreover, where, as here, there is a long postponement of the date for repayment, the Respondents might well visualise the need to take possession before that date and before the happening of any act or event within clause 4(A). Mr Lightman says they could protect themselves against the property being left vacant and suffering from vandalism or squatters by the mortgagor's liability for waste, but in my view that is not a sufficient answer. Taking possession may be a much better protection.

In short, it seems to me that clause 4(A) is at most neutral in this respect. It does not, in my judgment, show that obviousness or necessity which are required before a contractual term can be implied. Indeed, the argument may cut the other way. Clause 4(A) is dealing with statutory remedies. Taking possession is not a remedy but a right: see per Mr Justice Walton in the Esso Petroleum case at page 1484, line H. Accordingly, it may be said expressio unius exclusio alterius.

Finally, in this connection Mr Lightman argues that if the Respondents could take possession, they would be bound after paying outgoings to account, I suppose annually, to the Appellant for any surplus and, therefore, it would be a bootless exercise. In my judgment, however, that is not right. They could retain that surplus, and add it to their security, because a mortgagee in possession receives the rents and profits as owner, and it is only on redemption that he becomes liable to account. Indeed, subject always to that liability if and when the Appellant brings it home by redemption, the Respondents could, I conceive, occupy the property for their own use, for example by allowing one of their employees to live there rent-free. If equity could not stop a mortgagee from taking possession, and it is plain it could not, then it could not call on him to account save in a redemption action, but then it would impose not only liability on the footing of wilful default but also yearly rests. This conclusion appears to me to be plainly right on principle and see the extract from Professor Maitland's Lectures on Equity cited in Birmingham Citizens Permanent Building Society v. Caunt, 1962 1 Chancery at page 888. See also the passage cited from the judgment of Mr Justice Cross in Braithwaite v. Winwood, I960 1 Weekly Law Reports at page 1263, where he said 

"He would have to account strictly for his receipts in any redemption proceedings".

In my judgment, therefore, the suggested term cannot be implied, and this ground of appeal fails.

I turn to the alternative case for the Appellant which, he based on Section 36 of the Administration of Justice Act, 1970, and which may be summarised in the following propositions. First, that section applies where there is no money due and unpaid and no default consisting of a breach of any other obligation arising under or by virtue of the mortgage. Secondly, that the failure of the Appellant to keep up the original policy and the substituted policy, however much it might be a breach of his obligations under the assignment of the policy, was not a breach of any obligation arising under or by virtue of the mortgage, for the Respondents, for reasons good or bad, kept them separate. Thirdly, it follows on the Judge's construction of the mortgage, and on the basis on which this case has proceeded, as no act or event within clause 4(A) has occurred, that this is a case within the first proposition. Fourthly, that in such a case Section 36 either abrogates the mortgagee's common law right to take possession unless and until there be default in payment of money or a breach, of any other obligation under the mortgage, or the Court is bound to exercise its discretion in favour of the mortgagor, I suppose by granting an adjournment sine die.

In my judgment, the second proposition is right, and the third does follow, and the questions we have to decide are, therefore, whether the first, and either way of putting the fourth, be right, in which case the appeal must succeed, or whether both or either of the first and fourth propositions are wrong, in which case it fails.

In order to decide these questions, one must in my judgment consider first the purpose and effect of Section 36 in the case to which it indubitably applies, namely, where there is default either in payment of money or otherwise.

In my judgment, the words in subsection (1), to which my Lord has referred as the conditional clause, "if it appears to the court that in the event of its exercising the power the mortgagor is likely to be able within a reasonable period to pay any sums due under the mortgage or to remedy a default consisting of a breach of any other obligation arising under or by virtue of the mortgage", make it clear that the purpose of the section is to enable the Court in any of the ways specified in subsection (2) to grant a limited time, which may of course in a proper case be extended by a further exercise of the statutory powers, within which the mortgagor may put the matter right.

If that were in doubt, and in my view it is not, the legislature has itself removed the doubt by the Administration of Justice Act, 1973.  This was passed to remedy a defect in the earlier Act, under which in the case of an instalment mortgage with a provision that on default the whole should become due the Court could only grant relief on the terms that the mortgagor do pay off the whole principal sum and not merely the instalments in arrear. This remedial Act by its very nature emphasises the purpose of the earlier Act, but it goes further, because in Section 8, subsection (1), it actually describes the purpose of the 1970 Act in these terms: "under which a court has power to delay giving a mortgagee possession of the mortgaged property so as to allow the mortgagor a reasonable time to pay any sums due under the mortgage".

This being so, it is argued that the first proposition must be right, both because that is the natural meaning of the words of the section, and because if it be not so a mortgagor who is not in default will be in a worse position than one who is, and it is further argued that the fourth proposition must be right in one or other form, since otherwise the section produces a result which is preposterously absurd. If, so the argument runs, all the Court can do is to grant time to enable a mortgagor to pay what is due or to remedy any other default under the mortgage, and when that has been done the mortgagee is left with his absolute proprietary right to take possession, then, save where the money due is the whole amount under the mortgage and the case is not one within Section 8 of the 1973 Act, it is idle to grant the mortgagor time to pay the money or remedy the default.

I feel the force of these arguments, but I am not able to accede to them. I am satisfied that Section 36 of the 1970 Act cannot be held, as it were by a side wind, to have wholly abrogated the mortgagee's proprietary right to take possession, even when there is no default. This would not, I think, be applying the principle of liberal construction to avoid absurdity stated by Lord Reid in Luke v. Inland Revenue Commissioners, 1963 Appeal Cases at page 577, but disregarding the statute or overriding it, which, as Mr Justice Ungoed-Thomas pointed out in Re Maryon Wilson's Will Trusts, 1968 Chancery at page 282, and in my Judgment rightly pointed out, is what the Court is not allowed to do. Nor, in my judgment, by parity of reasoning, can it be said that the Court has a discretion but is bound to exercise it against the mortgagee where there is no money due or other default under the mortgage. Apart from the illogicality of saying that the Court has a discretion, but is bound to exercise it in a particular way, this would really come back to abrogating the right.

It seems to me that there are only two courses open to the Court; the one preferred by my brethren to construe the clause as conferring a discretion in all cases, reading the conditional clause merely as a qualification on that discretion in the case of unpaid money due or other default; the other to construe the section literally and face whatever anomalies or absurdities that produces. For my part, with all respect, I think the latter is the correct course. It is, in my judgment, inescapable that the result of their construction is that the section operates as a positive enactment disentitling the mortgagee to exercise his proprietary right to take possession save on showing some cause other than the mere existence of his right as legal owner. That is perhaps less startling than saying that the right is wholly abrogated save upon default, but in my view it comes very near to it. Further, I find it very difficult to see how this section can be held to give the Court power to adjourn, whether sine die or for a fixed period, where there is no money due which ought to be paid, or other default to be remedied, or by what criterion it could determine what should be a reasonable period. It is one thing to grant an adjournment to enable something specific to be done, such as is contemplated by the conditional clause. It is altogether different to grant an adjournment to see if some act, event or failure may occur which will entitle the mortgagee to exercise a right which at the time of the adjournment he does not possess, since ex hypothesi he is not entitled to exercise his proprietary right save on due cause "being shown.

On the other hand, the anomalies and absurdities said to flow from the literal construction may be more apparent than real, because of the equitable liability to account on the footing of wilful default. Where there has never been any default, or where the Court has allowed time for it to be remedied, which has been done, the mortgagee will not ordinarily be in a position to exercise any power of sale, and, therefore, will generally not wish to go on and got possession, unless indeed there is some reason apart from default in payment or other obligation, for example if the premises have been left vacant, in which case there is nothing anomalous, unjust or ridiculous in allowing him to do so.

It may be that the Legislature overlooked the fact that the mortgagee's right is not dependent on default, or, more probably I think, it was concerned only to give a defaulting mortgagor a chance to make good his default, leaving everything else, that is to say his position on doing so, and the case where there has been no default to the protection of the equitable doctrine of accountability which has sufficed well in the past.

Be that as it may, in my judgment, Section 36 does not apply where there is no money due, and no other default, and, therefore, this appeal fails. If that be wrong, however, then in my judgment the construction my brethren have adopted must be right, and in that case I respectfully entirely agree both with them and with the learned Judge below that it would not be right, in the circumstances of this case, to exercise the Court's discretion under Section 36 so as to grant any indulgence or further indulgence to the Appellant, and I respectfully agree with the Order my Lord has proposed.

Order:- Appeal dismissed with costs against the Appellant up to the date of his Legal Aid Certificate; costs of the appeal from the date of the Legal Aid certificate to be paid out of the Legal Aid Fund, that Order not to be proceeded upon for three weeks, to give the Law Society an opportunity to make representations. Possession to be given within 14 days. Legal Aid taxation for the Appellant. Leave to appeal to the House of Lords refused.

REVISED
THE MASTER OP THE ROLLS:  In this case we do not know the true facts.  We only know the allegations in the pleadings. According to them Timothy Murphy was a man of 29.  He was a self-employed builder, that is, on the "lump" earning "between £60 and £70 a week.  On the 19th September, 1974 he, with some other men, made a wicked plot together.  They decided to beat up another man called John Joseph Culhane.  They went to an address at 20 Grove Place in Greater London.  We do not know anything of what took place except that there was a "criminal affray".  Luring it John Culhane is said to have struck Timothy Murphy on the head with a plank, and killed him.  John Culhane was charged with murder.  He was tried at the Central Criminal Court on the 25th April, 1975.  At first, he pleaded not guilty, but after the case had been opened and some evidence heard, he changed his plea to Guilty of manslaughter.  He was sentenced to eight years which was reduced to five years by the Court of Appeal.

Timothy Murphy's widow now brings an action against John Culhane for damages under the Fatal Accidents Act, claiming damages on behalf of herself and her baby daughter. I do not suppose he has any money to pay any damages as he is still in prison.  But legal aid has, I believe, been granted to both sides.

The question is whether or not Mrs. Murphy is entitled to judgment on the pleadings without any trial.  The statement of claim says:
"On or about the nineteenth day of September, 1974, near Grove Place, in the Area of Greater London, the Defendant assaulted and beat the Deceased by striking him on the head with a plank.  The said assault was unlawful.  The Plaintiff intends to adduce evidence pursuant to Section 11 of the Civil Evidence Act, 1968, that the Defendant was on the 25th day of April, 1975, convicted on his own plea of guilty before the Central Criminal Court of manslaughter of the Deceased".

The Defence admits those allegations and further admits that, by reason of the assault, the deceased was killed.  It then says:
 "The said assault occurred during and as part of a criminal affray which was initiated by the Deceased and others who had together come to 20 Grove Place on the occasion in question with the joint criminal intent of assaulting and beating the Defendant".

That is followed by legal contentions of ex turpi causa non oritur actio, volenti non fit injuria, and that the deceased's said death was caused in part by his own aforesaid fault.

On those pleadings the plaintiff applied for judgment under Order 27 Rule 3 which gives the court power to give judgment on admissions.  The Master and the Judge both felt that, on the state of the authorities, they were bound to give judgment for Mrs. Murphy and shut out these defences of Mr. Culhane.  Judgment was given for damages to be assessed. I gather that the Judge felt most unwilling to do this, but felt he was bound by the cases.  So I must deal with them.

There are two cases which seem to show that, in a civil action for damages for assault, it is no answer for the defendant to say that the plaintiff was himself guilty of provocation.  The only defences would appear to be that the assault was done in self-defence or by accident.  Provocation, it is said, can be used to wipe out the element of exemplary damages but not to reduce the actual figure of pecuniary damages.  It was so said by the High Court of Australia in 1962 in the case of Fontin v. Katapodis, reported in (1962-1963) Commonwealth Law Reports 177 and followed by this court in 1968 in Lane v. Holloway (1968) 1 Queen's Bench 379.  But those were cases where the conduct of the injured man was trivial - and the conduct of the defendant was savage -entirely out of proportion to the occasion.  I do not think they can or should he applied where the injured man, by his own conduct, did provoke the other to retaliate by force proportionate to the occasion.  So far as general principle is concerned, I would like to repeat what I said in the later case of Gray v. Barr (1971) 2 Queen's Bench at 569: "In an action for assault, in awarding damages, the judge or jury can take into account, not only circumstances which go to aggravate damages, but also those which go to mitigate them".  That is the principle I prefer to the earlier cases.  Apart altogether from damages, however, I think there may well be a defence on liability.  If Murphy was one of a gang which set out to beat up Culhane, it may well be that he could not sue for damages if he got more than he bargained for.  A man who takes part in a criminal affray may well be said to have been guilty of such a wicked act as to deprive himself of a cause of action, or, alternatively, to have had taken upon himself the risk.  I put the case in the course of argument: Suppose that a burglar breaks into a house and the householder, finding him there, picks up a gun and shoots him - using more force, may be, than is reasonably necessary.  The householder may be guilty of manslaughter and liable to be brought before the criminal court.  But I doubt very much whether the burglar's widow will have an action for damages.  The householder might well have a defence either on the ground of ex turpi causa non oritur actio or volenti non fit injuria.  So in the present case it is open to the defendant to raise both those defences.  Such defences would go to the whole claim.

There is another point, too, even if the widow were entitled to damages under the Fatal Accidents Act, they fall to be reduced under the Law Reform Contributory Negligence Act, 1945 because the death of her husband might be the result partly of his own fault and partly of the default of the defendant: see section 1(1) and section 1(4) of the Act. On this point I must explain a sentence in Gray v. Barr]

REVISED
THE MASTER OP THE ROLLS:  In this case we do not know the true facts.  We only know the allegations in the pleadings. According to them Timothy Murphy was a man of 29.  He was a self-employed builder, that is, on the "lump" earning "between £60 and £70 a week.  On the 19th September, 1974 he, with some other men, made a wicked plot together.

[
LORD JUSTICE MEGAW:   On 19th April, 1972, the plaintiff, Mr. Michael Joseph Ferguson, fell some 15 feet from a flat roof on which he was working.  He suffered serious injuries.  He claimed damages for breach of statutory duty from the defendants, John Dawson & Partners (Contractors) Ltd.  The action was heard by Mr. Justice Boreham in the Crown Court at Leeds.  On 28th July, 1975, the learned judge gave judgment for the plaintiff for £30,387.88, including interest; The defendants appeal on issues as to liability.  There is no appeal as to the amount of damages.

The facts of the accident are not in dispute.  The defendants were contractors who had undertaken building operations for the extension of a shop building in Walmgate, York.  The work had involved the use of scaffolding erected on a flat roof.  The scaffolding, after that part of the work had been finished, was taken down.  The day after it had been taken down the plaintiff was ordered by Mr, Murray, the defendants' site agent, to remove some 12 or 14 scaffold boards which had been left on the flat roof.  There was also some rubble on the roof.  The plaintiff was to throw the scaffold boards over the edge of the flat roof to the ground below.  He had thrown down 2 or 3 boards.  When he was engaged in throwing down another board, he stumbled and fell off the flat roof.  There was no guard rail on the flat roof.

Regulation 28 (1) of the Construction (Working Places) Regulations, 1966, so far as is relevant, provides:  

"Guard rails and toe-boards at working platforms and places.  Every side of a working platform or working place, being a side thereof from which a person is liable to fall a distance of more than 6 feet 6 inches, shall,.., be provided with a suitable guard rail or guard rails of adequate strength to a height of between 3 feet and 3 feet 9 inches above the platform or place,..."

Regulation 3 (1) (a), so far as is relevant, reads:  

"It shall be the duty of every contractor, and every employer of workmen, who is undertaking any of the operations or works to which these Regulations apply - (a) to comply with such of the requirements of the following Regulations as affect him or any workman employed by him, that is to say, Regulations 6 to 23, 25, 30, 31, 32, 36 and 38 and, in so far as they relate to the falling or slipping of persons, Regulations 24, 26, 27, 28, 29, 33, 34 and 35...."

The learned judge held, contrary to the defendants' submissions: 

(i) that the plaintiff was employed by the defendants so that the defendants owed to him the statutory duty comprised in regulation 28 (1); and

(ii) that the place where the plaintiff was working when the accident happened, the flat roof, was a "working place" within regulation 28 (1).

The defendants appeal on each of those issues, I propose to deal first, out of logical order, with the second of those issues.  The defendants have at all times conceded that this flat roof in all its characteristics except one would be a working place within the regulation.  The one essential characteristic which is said to be missing is the length of time for which the place was going to be used by the plaintiff for the purposes of the work which he had been required to do.  The authorities Gill v. Humberstone (1963) 1 Weekly Law Reports 929, a decision of the House of lords, and Kelly v. Pierhead Ltd. (1967) 1 Weekly Law Reports 65 and Boynton v. Willment (1971) 1 Weekly Law Reports 1625, decisions of this Court, say that a necessary characteristic of a working place is that it is to be used for work for "an appreciable time".  The defendants say that the intended use here, namely the removal from the roof and the throwing to the ground of 12 or 14 scaffold boards, did not involve work at this place, on the flat roof, for "an appreciable time"  The judge held on the evidence that that work would have taken about 10 or 15 minutes.  The judge, in error, thought that the plaintiff's instructions had included also the removal of rubble from the roof.  But in my judgment that mistake does not matter.  In any ordinary use of the word "appreciable", which word is accepted by both parties as being the relevant adjective, the 10 or 15 minutes required for the plaintiff's intended work was an appreciable time,  I do not find it necessary to consider the further submission by Mr. Beldam for the plaintiff that the evidence indicates that there must have been a substantial period of time during which work was being carried out, though not by the plaintiff himself, on this flat roof on the previous day and also on the morning of the accident.  Mr. Popplewell submits that the plaintiff cannot rely upon such work by other persons to whom no duty may have been owed by the defendants.  But the 10 or 15 minutes is an appreciable time.  The appeal on that issue fails.

I turn to the other issue. Was the plaintiff employed by the defendants? For the plaintiff it is submitted that he was employed by the defendants under a contract of service.  For the defendants it is contended that the contract was a contract for services, and therefore the defendants were not under a statutory duty to him to provide a guard for the working place.  For if it were a contract for services the plaintiff would not have been "employed" by the defendants; and in the circumstances of this accident regulation 3 (1) (a) would not have brought regulation 28 (1) into effect so as to impose on the defendants a duty towards the plaintiff.  Regulation 28 (1) is brought into operation only in relation to "the falling or slipping of persons" (which this accident was) so far as the requirements of that regulation "affect....any workman employed by him":  "him", here, being the defendants.  Regulation 3 (1) (b) has a wider scope as regards the persons who are under the duty; but it is confined to "the falling of materials and articles".

It is conceded by the defendants that if the plaintiff was employed under a contract of service, they were, subject only to the issue as to "appreciable time", under a duty to the plaintiff; they failed to carry out that duty; and that failure was the cause of the accident.  But, say the defendants, the plaintiff was employed under a contract for services:  he was "self-employed":  he owed a salutatory duty to himself to take the statutory precautions (Smith. v. Wimpey Bros. (1972) 2 Queen's Bench 329).  It was for him, under the regulations, not for the defendants, to ensure that the guard rail was erected.  The defendants were under no such duty.

What is the basis for that contention? The judge accepted the evidence given by Mr. Murray, the defendants' site agent, as to the circumstances in which the plaintiff came to work for the defendants in January, 1972, some three months before the accident happened. The evidence was simply this:  the plaintiff came with four other Irishmen, already working for the defendants, and he asked, or perhaps one of his friends asked, if he could "come along". Mr.Murray's evidence is:  

"I said he could start on Monday and that was it.  But I did inform him there were no cards; we were purely working as a lump labour force".

Mr. Ferguson gave a false name, Goff.  That was the name by which he was known to Mr. Murray.  That was the name in which he signed at least some receipts for the moneys paid to him weekly -referred to by Mr. Murray in evidence as "his wages".  The evidence showed that, as was no doubt intended as a feature of the so-called "lump", the defendants did not make deductions in respect of income tax from the weekly payments to the plaintiff; nor did they make any payments in respect of insurance contributions.  They did not have his insurance card, nor his tax form, known as P.45.  It is fair to the defendants to say that this engagement of the plaintiff, in January, 1972, whatever its legal effect, was made some months before the provisions of section 28 of the Finance Act, 1971, came into effect.  When those provisions came into force on 1st April, 1972, the defendants thereafter, up to the time of the accident, deducted 30 per cent, from the sums due to the plaintiff, since he did not have a certificate, as specified in the Act, entitling him to exemption from P.A.Y.E. deductions.

In the circumstances, although neither party has raised, or wishes to raise, any issue as to possible illegality  arising in particular out of the judge's reference to the plaintiff's use of a false name in conjunction with the facilities afforded by "the lump" as being "a thoroughly dishonest device" for the purpose of evading his tax liabilities  we thought it right to raise the question on our own initiative.  However, I think Mr. Beldam is justified in his submission that, however suspicious the facts may appear - and they are indeed gravely suspicious - it would not be right for this Court to hold affirmatively that there was here dishonesty which would affect the contract, whatever it was, with illegality.  Mr. Beldam stresses that the plaintiff has not been given the opportunity to answer any questions suggesting such dishonesty.  He was not cross-examined on that topic.  The defendants did not seek to raise it.  The judge asked no questions about it.  In those circumstances we did not think it necessary to consider further arguments which Mr. Beldam would have wished to present, if the Court had held that there was here illegality affecting the contract, to the effect that in the circumstances such illegality of the contract or dishonesty of the plaintiff ought not to affect the plaintiff's right of recovery for a breach of statutory duty by the defendants, even though the defendants were themselves innocent of any complicity in the dishonesty and illegality.  Moreover, if dishonesty and illegality were to be an issue, it would have been for consideration whether questions of possible complicity by the defendants might not also have been relevant to any decision as to the legal consequences. That question, again, was not raised with any witness, and it would be wrong, on the material which is available, that the defendants should be held, or assumed, to have been themselves dishonest, or to have connived at dishonesty of the plaintiff.

I return to the question of the plaintiff's status: was he employed under a contract of service or a contract for services?

The defendants' argument is largely founded on the passage in Mr. Murray's evidence which I have quoted already, and on the judge's exposition (not based on anything specifically contained in the evidence) of the meaning of that passage.  The judge as a result of that evidence, rejecting completely the plaintiff's evidence to a different effect, held that the plaintiff "regarded himself as working on the lump".  The judge then says (at page 36/F of the transcript of the judgment):  "I am satisfied that the plaintiff and the defendants regarded the plaintiff as 'self-employed labour only sub-contractor' and in this there were advantages for each side". The judge then summarises those advantages, which included, for the defendants, escaping liability for payment of Selective Employment Tax in respect of the plaintiff; and for the plaintiff, evading, as the judge thought, his liability for income tax.

The defendants say that the judge has thus held that the contract is to be treated as though it contained an express term by which both parties had agreed that the plaintiff's relationship to the defendants - his status in the work which he would do on the defendants' behalf - would be "a self-employed labour-only sub-contractor".  There are no other contractual terms, the defendants say: or, at least, no admissible evidence of any other contractual terms. That, say the defendants, is the end of this case; it is the end of any claim by the plaintiff in respect of breach of statutory duty by the defendants; for by agreement between the parties - the only-agreement between them - the plaintiff was self-employed.  If he was self-employed, say the defendants, he was not employed by the defendants.  So regulation 3 (1) (a) did not put the defendants under a regulation 28 statutory duty to the plaintiff to see that guard rails were erected at the working place.  That duty was the plaintiff's own duty.

The judge rejected that argument.  He said (I quote from the transcript of the judgment at page 38/F):  "For the plaintiff it is contended that I must look at the realities of the situation and not to the form alone, and particularly not alone to the label that was put upon the plaintiff by both plaintiff and defendant, for it is contended that the form may be, and in this case is, a mere facade; whether or not the plaintiff regarded himself, whether or not the defendants regarded him, as 'self-employed labour only contractor', may be a matter, a serious matter, to be taken into consideration, but it is by no means conclusive, and the question remains whether in reality the relationship of master and servant existed".

The judge then considered various authorities and in particular the judgment of Mr. Justice MacKenna in Ready Mixed Concrete (South East) Ltd. v. Minister of Pensions and National Insurance (1968) 2 Queen's Bench 497. Applying the tests and criteria suggested in that case to the realities of the plaintiff's employment as, in the judge's view, they had emerged in evidence in this case, the learned judge arrived at the following conclusion (I read from page 44/B of the transcript of the judgment):  

"I accept what the parties accept, namely, the label, as a guide and no more.  I regard the concept of 'the Lump' in the circumstances of the present case as no more than a device which each side regarded as being capable of being put to his own advantage in a manner that I have attempted to describe earlier in this judgment, but which in reality did not affect the relationship of the parties or the performance of the substance of the contract between them".

The judge was in my opinion right in his approach and in his conclusion.

Certainly it had not crossed Mr. Murray's mind that by reason of anything he had said he had altered the obligations which the defendants would have had for the safety of workmen on their site, as compared with what those obligations would have been apart from his reference to "the lump".  In cross-examination, Mr. Murray seems to have had no hesitation in accepting that he (on behalf of the defendants) was responsible for providing scaffold guard rails and toe boards and that sort of thing for the safety of labourers on the site.  But, of course, Mr. Murray may have been mistaken about the legal effect of the words which he used.

The defendants, as I have said, contend that the contract which governed the legal relationship between the plaintiff and the defendants for the three months up to the time of the accident was a single-term contract.  The single term, derived from Mr. Murray's words "I did inform him that there were no cards, we were purely working as a lump labour force", was that the plaintiff's status vis-a-vis the defendants was to be, or was to be deemed to be, "a self-employed labour-only sub-contractor".

I shall assume for present purposes, though counsel for the plaintiff was not disposed to accept the assumption, that this is a correct interpretation of the intended, and understood, meaning of the Delphic words which were spoken by Mr. Murray and tacitly accepted by the plaintiff.

I am not, however, prepared to accept the defendants' further contention that there were no other terms of the contract.  Indeed, if there were no other terms, the only conclusion in law, I think, would be the absurd conclusion that there was no contract at all during the 3 months in which the plaintiff was working for the defendants.  Counsel for the defendants, when this was put to him, was disposed to accept that there must have been a contractual term as to remuneration.  There must, as I think, have been many other contractual terms, also necessarily to be implied, even though they were not mentioned in the brief conversation v/hen Mr. Murray and the plaintiff agreed that the plaintiff should start work on the following Monday.  This is so, whether the contract was a contract of service or for services.  For example, what sort of work could the defendants require the plaintiff to do? Was he to work in his own time or during stated hours and, if so, what hours? Where could he be required to work? What notice, if any, was required by either side for the termination of the contract? What control could the defendants through Mr. Murray exercise over the order in which the plaintiff did such work as he might be required to do, or the manner of doing it?

In my opinion, the law is not so divorced from reality as to assume that the same considerations as to the ascertainment of the relevant contractual terms, if a legal analysis of the terms has to be made for any purpose, applies to a contract of the nature with which we are here concerned, the taking on of a labourer on casual application to a site agent on a building site, as applies to commercial contracts between business men, whether made orally after discussion of terms or made in writing with elaborate provisions. The terms - even the essential terms - of a contract of the present nature would often not be spoken or written at the time when the workman is taken on.  They would be understood by reference to the known circumstances and the existing practices and conventions of a particular trade or a particular contractor or a particular site. Moreover, if and in so far as they were not implied, by common knowledge of what the practice was, at the time when the labourer was first taken on - the date when the legal analysis would regard the contract as being made - terms could well be added thereafter, as particular questions of the rights and obligations of the parties arose during the progress of the work.  Again, to apply legal analysis, such terms would be treated as having been added, or the contract as being varied.

In this context of the implication of terms, I would refer to what was so helpfully said by Lord Wilberforce in the recent House of Lords case, Liverpool City Council v. Irwin (1976) 2 Weekly Law Reports 562, at pages 566 to 567/D.  In the last paragraph of that passage, Lord Wilberforce said:  

"The present case, in my opinion, represents a fourth category, or I would rather say a fourth shade on a continuous spectrum.  The court here is simply concerned to establish what the contract is, the parties not having themselves fully stated the terms.  In this sense the court is searching for what must be implied".

So also in this case with which we are concerned.

Accordingly I reject the defendants' contention that on legal analysis there were no contractual terms governing the relationship between the plaintiff and the defendants other than a term "self-employed labour-only sub-contractor".  There were such other contractual terms.  For this purpose it does not matter whether they were originally incorporated by implication when the plaintiff was taken on by Mr. Murray in January, 1972, or were added thereafter by the acceptance of the parties by conduct.  What the relevant terms were was sufficiently proved by the evidence of Mr. Murray himself, the defendants' site agent, in cross-examination.  His evidence, except in minor respects, is not, as the defendants suggest, merely evidence of what was done in performance of the contract.  It is evidence of what the contractual rights and obligations were throughout the plaintiff's work for the defendants.  True, it is not expressed in the questions and answers as being agreed terms of a contract.  But I have no doubt that Mr. Murray understood, and everyone understood, that what he was being asked about was the relationship between the parties - the rights and obligations of the defendants and the workmen, including the plaintiff, which were understood and accepted to exist:  that is, on legal analysis, the contractual terms.

Miller v. Whitworth (1970) Appeal Cases 583 and Schuler v. Wickham (1974) Appeal Cases 235, House of Lords authorities relied on by the defendants, are not relevant.  They hold that, subject to certain exceptions, you may not look at what has been done in pursuance of a contract in order to construe that contract.  There are a number of other reasons, also, why I think those decisions are not relevant here.  But the main reason is that we are not here concerned with construing a contract, but with evidence as to what the terms of a contract were - the implication of terms within Lord Wilberforce' s fourth category or fourth "shade of the spectrum".

Mr. Murray accepted that he was responsible for "hiring and firing".  In other words, as between the defendants and the workmen, including the plaintiff, he, Mr. Murray, could dismiss them. There is no question of his determining a contract between the defendants and a sub-contractor.  He could move men from site to site, if he was so minded; and, in support of the existence of that contractual right on behalf of the defendants, he gave instances of having done so.  If tools were required for the work, it was for the defendants to provide them.  Again, as confirmation of that contractual obligation, Mr. Murray gave evidence of instances where the plaintiff had required tools for the work which he had been required to do, and the defendants had provided them.  It was for Mr. Murray to tell the workmen, including the plaintiff, what particular work they were to do:  "I tell him what to take and what to do".  The centurion in St, Matthew's Gospel says to the man under him "Do this, and he doeth it".  The man under him is a servant, not an independent contractor.  All these things are in relation to the contractual relationships existing.  "I tell him what to do" and he does it on Mr. Murray's instructions "because, when legal analysis has to be applied, it is a term of the contract that the plaintiff shall carry out the defendants' instructions what to do when they tell him to do it.  The men, including the plaintiff, were employed on an hourly basis.  The money paid to them would be correctly described as "a wage".

In my judgment, on the tests laid down in the authorities, all of this indicates beyond doubt that the reality of the relationship was employer and employee - a contract of service.  I do not propose to lengthen this judgment by examining afresh the criteria, so fully discussed in so many cases.  The judge, as I have already said, based himself on the judgment of Mr. Justice MacKenna in Ready Mixed Concrete (South East) Ltd. v. Minister of Pensions and National Insurance (1968) 2 Queen's Bench 497.  Another judgment which I have found very helpful is that of Mr. Justice Cooke in Market Investigations Ltd. v. Minister of Social Security (1969) 2 Queen's Bench 173.

My own view would have been that a declaration by the parties, even if it be incorporated in the contract, that the workman is to be, or is to be deemed to be, self-employed, an independent contractor, ought to be wholly disregarded - not merely treated as not being conclusive - if the remainder of the contractual terms, governing the realities of the relationship, show the relationship of employer and employee.  The Roman soldier would not have been a self-employed labour-only sub-contractor because of any verbal exchange between him and the centurion when he enlisted.  I find difficulty in accepting that the parties, by a mere expression of intention as to what the legal relationship should be, can in any way influence the conclusion of law as to what the relationship is.  I think that it would be contrary to the public interest if that were so:  for it would mean that the parties, by their own whim, by the use of a verbal formula, unrelated to the reality of the relationship, could influence the decision on whom the responsibility for the safety of workmen, as imposed by statutory regulations, should rest.  But, as I shall indicate later, I am prepared for the purposes of this appeal to accept a less stringent view of the law on this point, and my decision is therefore not based on that view.

I would apply the principle laid down by Lord Justice Jenkins in Addiscombe Garden Estates Ltd. v. Crabbe (1958) 1 Queen's Bench 513. That was a case where the issue was whether the legal relationship between the parties was that of landlord and tenant or licensor and licensee.  The relevant contractual document was clearly and deliberately directed towards emphasising that the relationship was that of licensor and licensee.  Yet the court held that it was not. Lord Justice Jenkins, at page 527, quotes from the judgment of Lord Justice Denning in Facchini v. Bryson (1952) 1 Times Law Reports 1386, at page 1389, as follows:  

"The occupation has all the features of a service tenancy, and the parties cannot by the mere words of their contract turn it into something else.  Their relationship is determined by the law and not by the label which they choose to put upon it".  

(Then Lord Justice Denning cited another authority and went on):  

"It is not necessary to go so far as to find the document a sham.  It is simply a matter of finding the true relationship of the parties.  It is most important that we should adhere to this principle, or else we might find all landlords granting licences and not tenancies, and we should make a hole in the Rent Acts through which could be driven - I will not in these days say a coach and four, but an articulated vehicle".   

That is the end of Lord Justice Jenkins' quotation from Lord Justice Denning. Lord Justice Jenkins himself goes on, at page 528 of the report, 

"The present case, of course, has nothing to do with the Rent Acts, but the important statement of principle is that the relationship is determined by the law, and not by the label which parties choose to put on it, and that it is not necessary to go so far as to find the document a sham.  It is simply a matter of ascertaining the true relationship of the parties".

So here.  Counsel for the plaintiff does not assert that the reference to "the lump", whatever the words meant, was, or involved, "a sham".  But, as the judgment of Lord Justice Jenkins shows, at least in certain types of case where the law has to decide whether the nature of a contract is A or B, even though the parties' expression of intention is not "a sham", it may still be properly ignored or overridden.  If that is the correct approach in a case such as Addiscombe, surely the present type of case is an even stronger one for the acceptance of that approach.  The parties cannot transfer a statute-imposed duty of care for safety of workmen from an employer to the workman himself merely because the parties agree, in effect, that the workman shall be deemed to be self-employed, where the true essence of the contract is, otherwise, a contract of service.

However, as I have previously indicated, I am content for the purposes of this appeal to accept, in favour of the defendants, the less stringent view which appears hitherto to have found favour in a number of cases:  that is, that the expression of the parties' intention may be a relevant factor, though certainly not a conclusive factor, in deciding what is the true nature of the contract. Thus, Mr. Justice MacKenna, in the Ready Mixed Concrete case (1968) 2 Queen's Bench 497 at page 312/H, expressed it, with deliberate circumspection, in these words:  

"It may be stated here that whether the relationship between the parties to the contract is that of master and servant or otherwise is a conclusion of law dependent upon the rights conferred and the duties imposed by the contract. If these are such that the relation is that of master and servant, it is irrelevant that the parties have declared it to be something else.  I do not say that a declaration of this kind is always necessarily ineffective.  If it were doubtful what rights and duties the parties wished to provide for, a declaration of this kind might help in resolving the doubt and fixing them in the sense required to give effect to that intention".

Lord Widgery, Chief Justice, in Global Plant Ltd. v. Secretary of State for Social Services (1972) 1 Queen's Bench 139 at page 152/D, put it more confidently, in these words:  

"One must not overlook that the intention of the parties was that the relationship should be that of an independent contractor, and although the parties cannot by intention make a transaction into something which it is not, yet it is recognised that such intention is a factor for consideration in these cases".

Incidentally, although in that case the court was considering whether or not a decision of the Minister should be quashed, the decision of the court shows that the mere fact that under the contract the workman receives his remuneration without deductions of P.A.Y.E. income tax and without having his insurance card stamped by the other party does not in itself necessarily, at least, involve the conclusion in law that it is not a contract of service.  For, despite these factors being present in that case, and despite the fact that the parties clearly intended that the contract should not have the legal effect of a contract of service, the Minister's decision that it did have that legal effect was upheld.

So on this basis, which for the purposes of this appeal I am prepared to assume in favour of the defendants to be correct, the parties' own expressed wish or intention may be a factor in determining what is the nature of the contract and thus in determining on whom the statutory duty is to rest.  On that basis, which the learned judge accepted, how did he deal with this issue? He said (I read from page 43/G of the transcript of judgment):  

"There remains the question:  What matters are alleged to be inconsistent with the relationship of master and servant? First, there is the fact that the plaintiff and the defendants both regarded or labelled him as a 'self-employed labour-only contractor'.  Secondly, there is the fact, and fact it is, that the plaintiff was supposed to pay his own insurance stamp as a self-employed person; that his wages were free of tax and that the obligation was upon him as upon a self-employed person to account to the Inland Revenue properly for tax.  But I ask this question:  When all the other indicia point to the relationship being that of master and servant, are these inconsistencies which should compel me to a contrary conclusion? It could not, as a true matter of law, be that they should so compel me".  

Then the learned judge makes reference to a case in the Queen's Bench Divisional Court and goes on:  "Nevertheless, should it lead me to that conclusion?  I think not".  Then there is a passage which I have already read but will read again:  "I accept what the parties accept, namely, the label, as a guide and no more. I regard the concept of 'the lump' in the circumstances of the present case as no more than a device which each side regarded as being capable of being put to his own advantage in a manner that I have attempted to describe earlier in this judgment, but which in reality did not affect the relationship of the parties or the performance of the substance of the contract between them".   "I therefore", says the judge, "arrive at the conclusion that this was in reality a contract of service and that the relationship of master and servant existed between the defendants and the plaintiff". 

I agree with all the judge says in that passage. 

I would dismiss the appeal. 

LORD JUSTICE LAWTON:   For many years past the building trade, and many outside it, have been familiar with phrases such as "working on the lump" or "working as a lump labour force".  The trade union movement has expressed grave concern about this method of working Parliament has had to protect the Revenue by legislation because of the difficulties which it creates in the collection of income tax: but no attempt has been made so far by statute to forbid it.  Indeed the Finance Act, 1971, recognised it as a way of working (see section 29) but put obstacles in the way of getting any fiscal benefits from it.  We were told by counsel for the defendants that this appeal was the first one, as far as he knew, which called for consideration of the legal consequences to anyone alleged to have been "working as a lump labour force" in relation to any injuries sustained whilst at work and as a result of the builder who had had the benefit of his work (I use a neutral phrase deliberately) failing to use the safeguards which he would have been obliged to use under statutory regulations for the safety of any workman employed by him.  What "working on the lump" or "as a lump working force" means must, of course, depend upon the evidence in each case.  The trial judge, however, held that both parties in this case regarded the plaintiff as a "self-employed labour-only sub-contractor". What was the legal effect of "working as a lump working force" when, as in this case, the plaintiff was taken on (again I use a neutral phrase) as a general labourer?

As a matter of law I can see no reason why a general labourer should not offer his labour on some such terms as these:  

"I do not mind what you ask me to do or where and when you ask me to do it hut you must understand that I am not going to call you master and I will not be your servant".  

Many men offer their labour on some such terms as these:  the jobbing gardener is familiar to us all, as are self-employed farm workers to East Anglian farmers.  When working they allow themselves to be controlled by those with whom they have made a bargain.  In most cases when the bargain is made nothing is said about control; but it is accepted by both parties as an implied term that the hirer will exercise control.  This does not mean either in fact or, in my opinion, in law that the hired man becomes a servant.

As I understood Mr. Beldam's argument on behalf of the plaintiff, he did not challenge the general proposition which I have set out above.  His case was that on the evidence the plaintiff did agree to work as the defendants' servant.  Mr, Popplewell's argument was that as the object of both parties to the hiring was to avoid the relationship of master and servant and the only express words of the bargain were to this effect, the implied understandings as to which party was to exercise control did not operate to destroy the object of the bargain and to override the only express term of it.

Now one thing is clear about the plaintiff's object in offering his labour to the defendants:  he did not like having income tax deducted from his earnings and wanted to avoid, maybe evade, paying any more tax than he had to do.  He was no twentieth century John Philpott Curran maintaining eternal vigilance to safeguard the right of individuals to be self-employed.  He must have known all about the deduction of income tax from earnings and the payment as an employed person of National Insurance contributions.  For many years he had been employed as a general labourer by builders.  The employer he had had for six years before he started work with the defendants had deducted tax from his earnings and had stamped his National Insurance card.  After leaving this employer and returning from a short visit to Ireland the plaintiff was unemployed for about a fortnight.  Pour of his friends were then working "on the lump" for the defendants.  They asked their foreman, a Mr. Murray, if he would take on the plaintiff.  He said he would.  Soon afterwards the plaintiff came along to the defendants to start work.  He spoke to Mr. Murray.  Prom the trial judge's findings I infer that he told Mr. Murray that his name was G-off.  There can only have been one reason for doing this, namely, to make the task of the Inland Revenue in tracing him more difficult.  Had I been sitting in another jurisdiction and the plaintiff had been charged before me with some offence concerned with the fraudulent evasion of tax, I should have had no hesitation in adjudging that his giving a false name was strong evidence of intending to evade fraudulently the payment of tax.  But, as Mr. Beldam pointed out, the plaintiff has not been charged with the fraudulent evasion of tax, and although the trial judge found that by giving a false name he was "a willing and dishonest party to a device to evade his tax liabilities", this had never been put to him in the witness-box so that he had never had an opportunity of meeting this allegation.  With some reluctance I felt bound to accept this submission, with the result that I have had to approach the problem presented by this appeal on the basis that the plaintiff intended to order his working relations with those who accepted his offer of work so that the tax attaching to his earnings under the appropriate Acts was less than it otherwise would have been.

There can be no doubt what the defendants' intention was.  Mr. Murray, whose evidence seems to have been accepted on this point, and generally, said:  "But I did inform him that there were no cards; we were purely working as a lump labour force".  The defendants could properly use independent sub-contractors. This is common in the building trade, and when skilled craftsmen are used, in most cases, if not all, there can be no doubt that such men are working as independent contractors.  The taking on of genuine independent sub-contractors provides builders with a number of administrative and fiscal advantages.  They are spared the task of accounting to the Inland Revenue for tax deducted from earnings and do not have to pay out money for the employer's contribution to National Insurance, In addition, when in 1972 the plaintiff was working for them they did not have to pay Selective Employment Tax.  Clearly Mr. Murray wanted to get these benefits for the defendants.

It follows that both parties to the labour bargain which was made in this case wanted to order their affairs so as. to avoid the incidence of taxation.  They could only succeed in doing so, however, if they avoided bringing into existence the relationship of master and servant.  This comes about because of the provisions of section 181 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act, 1970.  As is common knowledge, assessment for tax under Schedule D, which applies to the self-employed, gives small tax advantages which those assessed under Schedule E do not enjoy.  It is unnecessary to state what they are; but as every judge who has had experience of the criminal courts knows, and probably most of the public nowadays, it is not these advantages which attract many men who work "on the lump" but the opportunities for the evasion of tax which Schedule D provides. Section 181 (1) of the 1970 Act is in these terms:  "Schedule E. 1. Tax under this Schedule shall be charged in respect of any office or employment on emoluments therefrom...."  Section 204 (1) imposes upon any person who makes a payment of income assessable to tax under Schedule E the duty to deduct income tax.  Neither the plaintiff nor the defendants wanted these provisions to apply and they could only legally and effectively bring this about by agreeing that the defendants would not employ the plaintiff.  Assuming, as I must for the purposes of this appeal, that the parties were not conspiring with each other to evade tax fraudulently, this is what they thought they had done.  The defendants acted as if they had attained their objective.  They did not deduct tax until they were obliged to do so under the Finance Act, 1972, section 28.

If the avoidance of the relationship of master and servant was the prime object of the bargain, as I find it was from the circumstances in which it was made and the few words used, then I can see nothing in the implied terms which is inconsistent with this object. As I said at the beginning of this judgment, I can see no reason why in law a man cannot sell his labour without becoming another man's servant even though he is willing to accept control as to how, when and where he shall work.  If he makes his intention not to be a servant sufficiently clear, the implications which would normally arise from implied terms do not override the prime object of the bargain.  In my judgment this is just such a case.

I appreciate that there are powerful arguments for thinking that "working on the lump" is socially undesirable and that many men who do so work do not appreciate that they may be depriving themselves of safeguards which statutory regulations enact must be provided for employed men; but these considerations are not sufficiently strong to make labour bargains of this kind void as being against public policy.  If in a particular case the evidence leaves the court in doubt as to what the parties had agreed, there would, no doubt, be a finding which was more in accordance with public policy than against it.  That is not this case.  In my judgment there is no doubt what the parties intended and it was that the plaintiff should not be a servant of the defendants.  Anyway public policy is an awkward horse for a judge to ride, particularly when it wants to go in more than one direction.  Maybe the law should try to save workmen from their folly; but it should not encourage them to change a status which they have freely chosen when it suits them to do so.  In my judgment it would be contrary to public policy to allow a man to say he was self-employed for the purpose of avoiding the incidence of taxation but a servant for the purpose of claiming compensation.  For these reasons I would allow the appeal.

In coming to this conclusion I have not overlooked the decisions in Global Plant Ltd, v. Secretary of State for Social Services (1972) 1 Queen's Bench 139, Market Investigations v. Minister of Social Security (1969) 2 Queen's Bench 173 and Construction Industry Training Board v. Labour Force ltd. (1970) 3 All England Reports 220.  The first two were appeals by way of Case Stated, the last from a decision of the Industrial Tribunal.  In all three cases the appellate courts were concerned with deciding whether there had been errors in law.  This Court has a wider jurisdiction and is entitled to consider all the evidence given in the trial court.  That I have done and to that evidence I have sought to apply the principles which were discussed in these three cases.  In the enunciation of principle I found them helpful; but in the application of principle in the special jurisdiction with which these cases were concerned I got no help from them.

As I understand the law there is no single test for deciding whether a man is a servant of another.  Various factors have to be considered and weighed.  Control of working is one; intention is another; carrying on business on one's own account is a third.  The label which the parties attach to a bargain is not to be disregarded but it is far from being conclusive.  It was after considering and weighing these factors that I adjudged that the parties' intention to avoid the relationship of master and servant was the predominating and all-important factor.  I was helped in this decision by Mr. Beldam's acceptance that the bargain which the parties made was not a sham.

I should add that I agree with the judgment of Lord Justice Megaw on all the remaining points in this appeal. 

LORD JUSTICE BROWNE:   I agree with Lord Justice Megaw that this appeal should "be dismissed.  As to the "working place" point, I have nothing to add.  If Lord Justice Lawton did not think differently on the "employment" point, I should be content to say that I agree with Lord Justice Megaw for the reasons he has given and for the reasons given "by Mr. Justice Boreham in the passage at pages 43-44 of the transcript of his judgment which Lord Justice Megaw has read, hut as it is I think I should state my own reasons, even though they are really the same as those already given by Lord Justice Megaw.

As I understand it, Lord Justice Lawton's reasons for holding that the relationship of master and servant did not exist between the plaintiff and the defendants are:

(a)	Both parties wanted to order their affairs so as to avoid the incidence of taxation.
(b)	They could only succeed in doing this if they avoided bringing into existence the relationship of master and servant between them (see Income and Corporation Taxes Act, 1970, sections 181 (1) and 204 (1).
(c)	The avoidance of the relationship of master and servant was "the prime object of the bargain".
(d)	If the intention not to create the relationship of master and servant is sufficiently clear from the circumstances and the express words used, implications which would normally arise from implied terms do not override the prime object of the bargain.

If Lord Justice Lawton's view is right, I think it must follow that Global Plant Ltd. v. Secretary of State for Social Services (1972) 1 Queen's Bench 139 was wrongly decided.  In that case it had been expressly agreed between Global Plant and the man in question (supported by a written document) that he should be a self-employed sub-contractor, that tax should not be deducted by Global Plant, and that he should stamp his own insurance card (see pages 142/C-H and 148/E-149/D).  In spite of this, Lord Widgery, Chief Justice, held that the Secretary of State was not wrong in law in holding that, having regard to the other factors in that case, the relationship was that of master and servant (see page 152/D-E, which Lord Justice Megaw has already quoted, and pages 152-155).  I think it would probably also follow that the decision of the Divisional Court in Maurice Graham Ltd. v. Brunswick (1974) 16 Knight's Industrial Reports 153 was wrong, as Mr. Popplewell submitted.  These two cases are not binding on this Court, but in my view they were rightly decided, supported as I think they are by earlier authorities, including Ready Mixed Concrete (South East) Ltd. v. Minister of Pensions and National Insurance (1968) 2 Queen's Bench 497 and Market Investigations Ltd. v. Minister of Social Security (1969) 2 Queen's Bench 173.

Even if the "prime object of the bargain" between the plaintiff and the defendants in the present case was the avoidance of the relationship of master and servant, the question is whether they succeeded in that object.  The parties cannot by a label decide the true nature of their relationship (see especially the passage from Addiscombe Garden Estates v. Crabbe (1958) 1 Queen's Bench 513 which Lord Justice Megaw has quoted).  But I am afraid that I cannot agree with Lord Justice Lawton that this was the prime object of the bargain.  The prime object, I think, was that the plaintiff should work as a general labourer on sites where the defendants were carrying on their business as building contractors.  It is true that both parties intended that it was to be a term of the bargain that the defendants should not deduct tax and should not pay for the plaintiff's National Insurance stamps, but this was only one term.  I agree with Lord Justice Megaw that there must have been - and were - other terms, and that the court must look at the arrangements as a whole to decide what the real relationship was.

On the "basis of the single sentence in Mr. Murray's evidence which Lord Justice Megaw has quoted, Mr. Justice Boreham found that "the plaintiff and the defendants regarded the plaintiff as 'self-employed labour-only sub-contractor'" (transcript of judgment page 36).  I am not sure that I should have given that sentence such a wide and important effect.  The only evidence about what is meant by "being on the lump" was four questions and answers in the cross-examination of the plaintiff (page 7/A-B) and three in the re-examination of Mr. Murray (page 28/E-E).  The plaintiff said that it means that the employer does not deduct tax and the man stamps his own card, and Mr, Murray went no further; I doubt if either of them intended or understood what Mr. Murray said to mean more than that. But, like Lord Justice Megaw, I am prepared to assume that the judge's interpretation is right.  Even making this assumption, I agree with Lord Justice Megaw that this appeal fails, for the following reasons:

(1)	The term as to tax and stamps cannot have been the only term of the contract: as Lord Justice Megaw has pointed out, there would have been no contract at all unless there were other terms, tacitly understood, or "implied" in the sense explained by Lord Justice Megaw, and by Lord Wilberforce in the speech he has quoted,
(2)	Miller v, Whitworth Street Estates (1970) Appeal Cases 583 and E.L. Schuler A.G. v. Wickman Machine Tool Sales Ltd. (1974) Appeal Cases 235 are irrelevant.  Those cases were concerned with the construction of written contracts; the rule that "it is not legitimate to use as an aid in the construction of the contract anything which the parties said or did after it was made" (Lord Reid in Miller at page 603/E) is only a particular application of "the general rule....that extrinsic evidence is not admissible for the construction of a written contract; the parties' intentions must be ascertained, on legal principles of construction, from the words they have used" (Lord Wilberforce in Schuler at page 261/B; on this point he agreed with the other members of the House, though he dissented on another point).  In the present case, the question is not one of the construction of the contract, but what were the terms of an oral and only partially expressed contract.  In my opinion, the court can in such a ease take into account what was done later as a basis for inferring what was agreed when the contract was made, or as establishing later additions or variations.  But I do not think this point arises in the present case, because I agree with Lord Justice Megaw that Mr. Murray's evidence related to what was understood by both parties at the time when the contract was made.  I need not set out that evidence or analyse it again, because I entirely agree with Lord Justice Megaw's statement of its effect. 

(3)	 I agree with Lord Justice Megaw and Mr. Justice Boreham that on the tests laid down by the authorities the evidence establishes beyond doubt that in reality the contract between the plaintiff and the defendants was a contract of service and their relationship was that of master and servant.  The Market Investigations case (1969) 2 Queen's Bench 173 does not seem to have been cited to Mr. Justice Boreham, but I think that the application of the test suggested by Mr. Justice Cooke in that case at page 184/G-H (which I find very helpful) strongly supports his conclusion.  After quoting Lord Wright, Lord Denning and the Supreme Court of the United States, Mr. Justice Cooke said that these observations "suggest that the fundamental test to be applied is this:  'Is the person who has engaged himself to perform these services performing them as a person in business on his own account?'.   If the answer is 'Yes', then the contract is a contract for services.  If the answer is 'No', then the contract is a contract of service".  On this test, the distinction between the plaintiff in the present case and the jobbing gardener is plain,

(4)	I agree with Lord Justice Megaw that a declaration by the parties ought to be disregarded if the remainder of the contractual terms show that the reality of the relationship is one of master and servant, but, like him, I am prepared to assume that the less stringent view adopted by the authorities is right - namely, that it is a relevant, but certainly not a conclusive, factor.

(5)	In my judgment, Mr. Justice Boreham directed himself rightly in law, subject to the additional test suggested by Mr. Justice Cooke to which I have referred and to (4) above; the omission of these factors makes the tests he applied more and not less favourable to the defendants.   When the right tests have been applied, the conclusion to be drawn is in my view a question of fact - see Global Plant (1972) 1 Queen's Bench at pages 152-155.   The appellants have entirely failed to satisfy me that Mr, Justice Boreham's conclusion, stated at pages 43-44 of his judgment, was wrong; in my judgment it was right.

As I have said, I would dismiss this appeal.

Mr. Beldam:

(Appeal dismissed with costs.  Leave to appeal to House of Lords.  Stay of execution to continue, the defendants undertaking, through counsel, to prosecute appeal, if taken, with due diligence)


]
[
LORD JUSTICE MEGAW:   On 19th April, 1972, the plaintiff, Mr. Michael Joseph Ferguson, fell some 15 feet from a flat roof on which he was working.  He suffered serious injuries.  He claimed damages for breach of statutory duty from the defendants, John Dawson & Partners (Contractors) Ltd.  The action was heard by Mr. Justice Boreham in the Crown Court at Leeds.  On 28th July, 1975, the learned judge gave judgment for the plaintiff for £30,387.88, including interest; The defendants appeal on issues as to liability.  There is no appeal as to the amount of damages.

The facts of the accident are not in dispute.  The defendants were contractors who had undertaken building operations for the extension of a shop building in Walmgate, York.  The work had involved the use of scaffolding erected on a flat roof.  The scaffolding, after that part of the work had been finished, was taken down.  The day after it had been taken down the plaintiff was ordered by Mr, Murray, the defendants' site agent, to remove some 12 or 14 scaffold boards which had been left on the flat roof.  There was also some rubble on the roof.  The plaintiff was to throw the scaffold boards over the edge of the flat roof to the ground below.  He had thrown down 2 or 3 boards.  When he was engaged in throwing down another board, he stumbled and fell off the flat roof.  There was no guard rail on the flat roof.

Regulation 28 (1) of the Construction (Working Places) Regulations, 1966, so far as is relevant, provides:  

"Guard rails and toe-boards at working platforms and places.  Every side of a working platform or working place, being a side thereof from which a person is liable to fall a distance of more than 6 feet 6 inches, shall,.., be provided with a suitable guard rail or guard rails of adequate strength to a height of between 3 feet and 3 feet 9 inches above the platform or place,..."

Regulation 3 (1) (a), so far as is relevant, reads:  

"It shall be the duty of every contractor, and every employer of workmen, who is undertaking any of the operations or works to which these Regulations apply - (a) to comply with such of the requirements of the following Regulations as affect him or any workman employed by him, that is to say, Regulations 6 to 23, 25, 30, 31, 32, 36 and 38 and, in so far as they relate to the falling or slipping of persons, Regulations 24, 26, 27, 28, 29, 33, 34 and 35...."

The learned judge held, contrary to the defendants' submissions: 

(i) that the plaintiff was employed by the defendants so that the defendants owed to him the statutory duty comprised in regulation 28 (1); and

(ii) that the place where the plaintiff was working when the accident happened, the flat roof, was a "working place" within regulation 28 (1).

The defendants appeal on each of those issues, I propose to deal first, out of logical order, with the second of those issues.  The defendants have at all times conceded that this flat roof in all its characteristics except one would be a working place within the regulation.  The one essential characteristic which is said to be missing is the length of time for which the place was going to be used by the plaintiff for the purposes of the work which he had been required to do.  The authorities Gill v. Humberstone (1963) 1 Weekly Law Reports 929, a decision of the House of lords, and Kelly v. Pierhead Ltd. (1967) 1 Weekly Law Reports 65 and Boynton v. Willment (1971) 1 Weekly Law Reports 1625, decisions of this Court, say that a necessary characteristic of a working place is that it is to be used for work for "an appreciable time".  The defendants say that the intended use here, namely the removal from the roof and the throwing to the ground of 12 or 14 scaffold boards, did not involve work at this place, on the flat roof, for "an appreciable time"  The judge held on the evidence that that work would have taken about 10 or 15 minutes.  The judge, in error, thought that the plaintiff's instructions had included also the removal of rubble from the roof.  But in my judgment that mistake does not matter.  In any ordinary use of the word "appreciable", which word is accepted by both parties as being the relevant adjective, the 10 or 15 minutes required for the plaintiff's intended work was an appreciable time,  I do not find it necessary to consider the further submission by Mr. Beldam for the plaintiff that the evidence indicates that there must have been a substantial period of time during which work was being carried out, though not by the plaintiff himself, on this flat roof on the previous day and also on the morning of the accident.  Mr. Popplewell submits that the plaintiff cannot rely upon such work by other persons to whom no duty may have been owed by the defendants.  But the 10 or 15 minutes is an appreciable time.  The appeal on that issue fails.

I turn to the other issue. Was the plaintiff employed by the defendants? For the plaintiff it is submitted that he was employed by the defendants under a contract of service.  For the defendants it is contended that the contract was a contract for services, and therefore the defendants were not under a statutory duty to him to provide a guard for the working place.  For if it were a contract for services the plaintiff would not have been "employed" by the defendants; and in the circumstances of this accident regulation 3 (1) (a) would not have brought regulation 28 (1) into effect so as to impose on the defendants a duty towards the plaintiff.  Regulation 28 (1) is brought into operation only in relation to "the falling or slipping of persons" (which this accident was) so far as the requirements of that regulation "affect....any workman employed by him":  "him", here, being the defendants.  Regulation 3 (1) (b) has a wider scope as regards the persons who are under the duty; but it is confined to "the falling of materials and articles".

It is conceded by the defendants that if the plaintiff was employed under a contract of service, they were, subject only to the issue as to "appreciable time", under a duty to the plaintiff; they failed to carry out that duty; and that failure was the cause of the accident.  But, say the defendants, the plaintiff was employed under a contract for services:  he was "self-employed":  he owed a salutatory duty to himself to take the statutory precautions (Smith. v. Wimpey Bros. (1972) 2 Queen's Bench 329).  It was for him, under the regulations, not for the defendants, to ensure that the guard rail was erected.  The defendants were under no such duty.

What is the basis for that contention? The judge accepted the evidence given by Mr. Murray, the defendants' site agent, as to the circumstances in which the plaintiff came to work for the defendants in January, 1972, some three months before the accident happened. The evidence was simply this:  the plaintiff came with four other Irishmen, already working for the defendants, and he asked, or perhaps one of his friends asked, if he could "come along". Mr.Murray's evidence is:  

"I said he could start on Monday and that was it.  But I did inform him there were no cards; we were purely working as a lump labour force".

Mr. Ferguson gave a false name, Goff.  That was the name by which he was known to Mr. Murray.  That was the name in which he signed at least some receipts for the moneys paid to him weekly -referred to by Mr. Murray in evidence as "his wages".  The evidence showed that, as was no doubt intended as a feature of the so-called "lump", the defendants did not make deductions in respect of income tax from the weekly payments to the plaintiff; nor did they make any payments in respect of insurance contributions.  They did not have his insurance card, nor his tax form, known as P.45.  It is fair to the defendants to say that this engagement of the plaintiff, in January, 1972, whatever its legal effect, was made some months before the provisions of section 28 of the Finance Act, 1971, came into effect.  When those provisions came into force on 1st April, 1972, the defendants thereafter, up to the time of the accident, deducted 30 per cent, from the sums due to the plaintiff, since he did not have a certificate, as specified in the Act, entitling him to exemption from P.A.Y.E. deductions.

In the circumstances, although neither party has raised, or wishes to raise, any issue as to possible illegality  arising in particular out of the judge's reference to the plaintiff's use of a false name in conjunction with the facilities afforded by "the lump" as being "a thoroughly dishonest device" for the purpose of evading his tax liabilities  we thought it right to raise the question on our own initiative.  However, I think Mr. Beldam is justified in his submission that, however suspicious the facts may appear - and they are indeed gravely suspicious - it would not be right for this Court to hold affirmatively that there was here dishonesty which would affect the contract, whatever it was, with illegality.  Mr. Beldam stresses that the plaintiff has not been given the opportunity to answer any questions suggesting such dishonesty.  He was not cross-examined on that topic.  The defendants did not seek to raise it.  The judge asked no questions about it.  In those circumstances we did not think it necessary to consider further arguments which Mr. Beldam would have wished to present, if the Court had held that there was here illegality affecting the contract, to the effect that in the circumstances such illegality of the contract or dishonesty of the plaintiff ought not to affect the plaintiff's right of recovery for a breach of statutory duty by the defendants, even though the defendants were themselves innocent of any complicity in the dishonesty and illegality.  Moreover, if dishonesty and illegality were to be an issue, it would have been for consideration whether questions of possible complicity by the defendants might not also have been relevant to any decision as to the legal consequences. That question, again, was not raised with any witness, and it would be wrong, on the material which is available, that the defendants should be held, or assumed, to have been themselves dishonest, or to have connived at dishonesty of the plaintiff.

I return to the question of the plaintiff's status: was he employed under a contract of service or a contract for services?

The defendants' argument is largely founded on the passage in Mr. Murray's evidence which I have quoted already, and on the judge's exposition (not based on anything specifically contained in the evidence) of the meaning of that passage.  The judge as a result of that evidence, rejecting completely the plaintiff's evidence to a different effect, held that the plaintiff "regarded himself as working on the lump".  The judge then says (at page 36/F of the transcript of the judgment):  "I am satisfied that the plaintiff and the defendants regarded the plaintiff as 'self-employed labour only sub-contractor' and in this there were advantages for each side". The judge then summarises those advantages, which included, for the defendants, escaping liability for payment of Selective Employment Tax in respect of the plaintiff; and for the plaintiff, evading, as the judge thought, his liability for income tax.

The defendants say that the judge has thus held that the contract is to be treated as though it contained an express term by which both parties had agreed that the plaintiff's relationship to the defendants - his status in the work which he would do on the defendants' behalf - would be "a self-employed labour-only sub-contractor".  There are no other contractual terms, the defendants say: or, at least, no admissible evidence of any other contractual terms. That, say the defendants, is the end of this case; it is the end of any claim by the plaintiff in respect of breach of statutory duty by the defendants; for by agreement between the parties - the only-agreement between them - the plaintiff was self-employed.  If he was self-employed, say the defendants, he was not employed by the defendants.  So regulation 3 (1) (a) did not put the defendants under a regulation 28 statutory duty to the plaintiff to see that guard rails were erected at the working place.  That duty was the plaintiff's own duty.

The judge rejected that argument.  He said (I quote from the transcript of the judgment at page 38/F):  "For the plaintiff it is contended that I must look at the realities of the situation and not to the form alone, and particularly not alone to the label that was put upon the plaintiff by both plaintiff and defendant, for it is contended that the form may be, and in this case is, a mere facade; whether or not the plaintiff regarded himself, whether or not the defendants regarded him, as 'self-employed labour only contractor', may be a matter, a serious matter, to be taken into consideration, but it is by no means conclusive, and the question remains whether in reality the relationship of master and servant existed".

The judge then considered various authorities and in particular the judgment of Mr. Justice MacKenna in Ready Mixed Concrete (South East) Ltd. v. Minister of Pensions and National Insurance (1968) 2 Queen's Bench 497. Applying the tests and criteria suggested in that case to the realities of the plaintiff's employment as, in the judge's view, they had emerged in evidence in this case, the learned judge arrived at the following conclusion (I read from page 44/B of the transcript of the judgment):  

"I accept what the parties accept, namely, the label, as a guide and no more.  I regard the concept of 'the Lump' in the circumstances of the present case as no more than a device which each side regarded as being capable of being put to his own advantage in a manner that I have attempted to describe earlier in this judgment, but which in reality did not affect the relationship of the parties or the performance of the substance of the contract between them".

The judge was in my opinion right in his approach and in his conclusion.

Certainly it had not crossed Mr. Murray's mind that by reason of anything he had said he had altered the obligations which the defendants would have had for the safety of workmen on their site, as compared with what those obligations would have been apart from his reference to "the lump".  In cross-examination, Mr. Murray seems to have had no hesitation in accepting that he (on behalf of the defendants) was responsible for providing scaffold guard rails and toe boards and that sort of thing for the safety of labourers on the site.  But, of course, Mr. Murray may have been mistaken about the legal effect of the words which he used.

The defendants, as I have said, contend that the contract which governed the legal relationship between the plaintiff and the defendants for the three months up to the time of the accident was a single-term contract.  The single term, derived from Mr. Murray's words "I did inform him that there were no cards, we were purely working as a lump labour force", was that the plaintiff's status vis-a-vis the defendants was to be, or was to be deemed to be, "a self-employed labour-only sub-contractor".

I shall assume for present purposes, though counsel for the plaintiff was not disposed to accept the assumption, that this is a correct interpretation of the intended, and understood, meaning of the Delphic words which were spoken by Mr. Murray and tacitly accepted by the plaintiff.

I am not, however, prepared to accept the defendants' further contention that there were no other terms of the contract.  Indeed, if there were no other terms, the only conclusion in law, I think, would be the absurd conclusion that there was no contract at all during the 3 months in which the plaintiff was working for the defendants.  Counsel for the defendants, when this was put to him, was disposed to accept that there must have been a contractual term as to remuneration.  There must, as I think, have been many other contractual terms, also necessarily to be implied, even though they were not mentioned in the brief conversation v/hen Mr. Murray and the plaintiff agreed that the plaintiff should start work on the following Monday.  This is so, whether the contract was a contract of service or for services.  For example, what sort of work could the defendants require the plaintiff to do? Was he to work in his own time or during stated hours and, if so, what hours? Where could he be required to work? What notice, if any, was required by either side for the termination of the contract? What control could the defendants through Mr. Murray exercise over the order in which the plaintiff did such work as he might be required to do, or the manner of doing it?

In my opinion, the law is not so divorced from reality as to assume that the same considerations as to the ascertainment of the relevant contractual terms, if a legal analysis of the terms has to be made for any purpose, applies to a contract of the nature with which we are here concerned, the taking on of a labourer on casual application to a site agent on a building site, as applies to commercial contracts between business men, whether made orally after discussion of terms or made in writing with elaborate provisions. The terms - even the essential terms - of a contract of the present nature would often not be spoken or written at the time when the workman is taken on.  They would be understood by reference to the known circumstances and the existing practices and conventions of a particular trade or a particular contractor or a particular site. Moreover, if and in so far as they were not implied, by common knowledge of what the practice was, at the time when the labourer was first taken on - the date when the legal analysis would regard the contract as being made - terms could well be added thereafter, as particular questions of the rights and obligations of the parties arose during the progress of the work.  Again, to apply legal analysis, such terms would be treated as having been added, or the contract as being varied.

In this context of the implication of terms, I would refer to what was so helpfully said by Lord Wilberforce in the recent House of Lords case, Liverpool City Council v. Irwin (1976) 2 Weekly Law Reports 562, at pages 566 to 567/D.  In the last paragraph of that passage, Lord Wilberforce said:  

"The present case, in my opinion, represents a fourth category, or I would rather say a fourth shade on a continuous spectrum.  The court here is simply concerned to establish what the contract is, the parties not having themselves fully stated the terms.  In this sense the court is searching for what must be implied".

So also in this case with which we are concerned.

Accordingly I reject the defendants' contention that on legal analysis there were no contractual terms governing the relationship between the plaintiff and the defendants other than a term "self-employed labour-only sub-contractor".  There were such other contractual terms.  For this purpose it does not matter whether they were originally incorporated by implication when the plaintiff was taken on by Mr. Murray in January, 1972, or were added thereafter by the acceptance of the parties by conduct.  What the relevant terms were was sufficiently proved by the evidence of Mr. Murray himself, the defendants' site agent, in cross-examination.  His evidence, except in minor respects, is not, as the defendants suggest, merely evidence of what was done in performance of the contract.  It is evidence of what the contractual rights and obligations were throughout the plaintiff's work for the defendants.  True, it is not expressed in the questions and answers as being agreed terms of a contract.  But I have no doubt that Mr. Murray understood, and everyone understood, that what he was being asked about was the relationship between the parties - the rights and obligations of the defendants and the workmen, including the plaintiff, which were understood and accepted to exist:  that is, on legal analysis, the contractual terms.

Miller v. Whitworth (1970) Appeal Cases 583 and Schuler v. Wickham (1974) Appeal Cases 235, House of Lords authorities relied on by the defendants, are not relevant.  They hold that, subject to certain exceptions, you may not look at what has been done in pursuance of a contract in order to construe that contract.  There are a number of other reasons, also, why I think those decisions are not relevant here.  But the main reason is that we are not here concerned with construing a contract, but with evidence as to what the terms of a contract were - the implication of terms within Lord Wilberforce' s fourth category or fourth "shade of the spectrum".

Mr. Murray accepted that he was responsible for "hiring and firing".  In other words, as between the defendants and the workmen, including the plaintiff, he, Mr. Murray, could dismiss them. There is no question of his determining a contract between the defendants and a sub-contractor.  He could move men from site to site, if he was so minded; and, in support of the existence of that contractual right on behalf of the defendants, he gave instances of having done so.  If tools were required for the work, it was for the defendants to provide them.  Again, as confirmation of that contractual obligation, Mr. Murray gave evidence of instances where the plaintiff had required tools for the work which he had been required to do, and the defendants had provided them.  It was for Mr. Murray to tell the workmen, including the plaintiff, what particular work they were to do:  "I tell him what to take and what to do".  The centurion in St, Matthew's Gospel says to the man under him "Do this, and he doeth it".  The man under him is a servant, not an independent contractor.  All these things are in relation to the contractual relationships existing.  "I tell him what to do" and he does it on Mr. Murray's instructions "because, when legal analysis has to be applied, it is a term of the contract that the plaintiff shall carry out the defendants' instructions what to do when they tell him to do it.  The men, including the plaintiff, were employed on an hourly basis.  The money paid to them would be correctly described as "a wage".

In my judgment, on the tests laid down in the authorities, all of this indicates beyond doubt that the reality of the relationship was employer and employee - a contract of service.  I do not propose to lengthen this judgment by examining afresh the criteria, so fully discussed in so many cases.  The judge, as I have already said, based himself on the judgment of Mr. Justice MacKenna in Ready Mixed Concrete (South East) Ltd. v. Minister of Pensions and National Insurance (1968) 2 Queen's Bench 497.  Another judgment which I have found very helpful is that of Mr. Justice Cooke in Market Investigations Ltd. v. Minister of Social Security (1969) 2 Queen's Bench 173.

My own view would have been that a declaration by the parties, even if it be incorporated in the contract, that the workman is to be, or is to be deemed to be, self-employed, an independent contractor, ought to be wholly disregarded - not merely treated as not being conclusive - if the remainder of the contractual terms, governing the realities of the relationship, show the relationship of employer and employee.  The Roman soldier would not have been a self-employed labour-only sub-contractor because of any verbal exchange between him and the centurion when he enlisted.  I find difficulty in accepting that the parties, by a mere expression of intention as to what the legal relationship should be, can in any way influence the conclusion of law as to what the relationship is.  I think that it would be contrary to the public interest if that were so:  for it would mean that the parties, by their own whim, by the use of a verbal formula, unrelated to the reality of the relationship, could influence the decision on whom the responsibility for the safety of workmen, as imposed by statutory regulations, should rest.  But, as I shall indicate later, I am prepared for the purposes of this appeal to accept a less stringent view of the law on this point, and my decision is therefore not based on that view.

I would apply the principle laid down by Lord Justice Jenkins in Addiscombe Garden Estates Ltd. v. Crabbe (1958) 1 Queen's Bench 513. That was a case where the issue was whether the legal relationship between the parties was that of landlord and tenant or licensor and licensee.  The relevant contractual document was clearly and deliberately directed towards emphasising that the relationship was that of licensor and licensee.  Yet the court held that it was not. Lord Justice Jenkins, at page 527, quotes from the judgment of Lord Justice Denning in Facchini v. Bryson (1952) 1 Times Law Reports 1386, at page 1389, as follows:  

"The occupation has all the features of a service tenancy, and the parties cannot by the mere words of their contract turn it into something else.  Their relationship is determined by the law and not by the label which they choose to put upon it".  

(Then Lord Justice Denning cited another authority and went on):  

"It is not necessary to go so far as to find the document a sham.  It is simply a matter of finding the true relationship of the parties.  It is most important that we should adhere to this principle, or else we might find all landlords granting licences and not tenancies, and we should make a hole in the Rent Acts through which could be driven - I will not in these days say a coach and four, but an articulated vehicle".   

That is the end of Lord Justice Jenkins' quotation from Lord Justice Denning. Lord Justice Jenkins himself goes on, at page 528 of the report, 

"The present case, of course, has nothing to do with the Rent Acts, but the important statement of principle is that the relationship is determined by the law, and not by the label which parties choose to put on it, and that it is not necessary to go so far as to find the document a sham.  It is simply a matter of ascertaining the true relationship of the parties".

So here.  Counsel for the plaintiff does not assert that the reference to "the lump", whatever the words meant, was, or involved, "a sham".  But, as the judgment of Lord Justice Jenkins shows, at least in certain types of case where the law has to decide whether the nature of a contract is A or B, even though the parties' expression of intention is not "a sham", it may still be properly ignored or overridden.  If that is the correct approach in a case such as Addiscombe, surely the present type of case is an even stronger one for the acceptance of that approach.  The parties cannot transfer a statute-imposed duty of care for safety of workmen from an employer to the workman himself merely because the parties agree, in effect, that the workman shall be deemed to be self-employed, where the true essence of the contract is, otherwise, a contract of service.

However, as I have previously indicated, I am content for the purposes of this appeal to accept, in favour of the defendants, the less stringent view which appears hitherto to have found favour in a number of cases:  that is, that the expression of the parties' intention may be a relevant factor, though certainly not a conclusive factor, in deciding what is the true nature of the contract. Thus, Mr. Justice MacKenna, in the Ready Mixed Concrete case (1968) 2 Queen's Bench 497 at page 312/H, expressed it, with deliberate circumspection, in these words:  

"It may be stated here that whether the relationship between the parties to the contract is that of master and servant or otherwise is a conclusion of law dependent upon the rights conferred and the duties imposed by the contract. If these are such that the relation is that of master and servant, it is irrelevant that the parties have declared it to be something else.  I do not say that a declaration of this kind is always necessarily ineffective.  If it were doubtful what rights and duties the parties wished to provide for, a declaration of this kind might help in resolving the doubt and fixing them in the sense required to give effect to that intention".

Lord Widgery, Chief Justice, in Global Plant Ltd. v. Secretary of State for Social Services (1972) 1 Queen's Bench 139 at page 152/D, put it more confidently, in these words:  

"One must not overlook that the intention of the parties was that the relationship should be that of an independent contractor, and although the parties cannot by intention make a transaction into something which it is not, yet it is recognised that such intention is a factor for consideration in these cases".

Incidentally, although in that case the court was considering whether or not a decision of the Minister should be quashed, the decision of the court shows that the mere fact that under the contract the workman receives his remuneration without deductions of P.A.Y.E. income tax and without having his insurance card stamped by the other party does not in itself necessarily, at least, involve the conclusion in law that it is not a contract of service.  For, despite these factors being present in that case, and despite the fact that the parties clearly intended that the contract should not have the legal effect of a contract of service, the Minister's decision that it did have that legal effect was upheld.

So on this basis, which for the purposes of this appeal I am prepared to assume in favour of the defendants to be correct, the parties' own expressed wish or intention may be a factor in determining what is the nature of the contract and thus in determining on whom the statutory duty is to rest.  On that basis, which the learned judge accepted, how did he deal with this issue? He said (I read from page 43/G of the transcript of judgment):  

"There remains the question:  What matters are alleged to be inconsistent with the relationship of master and servant? First, there is the fact that the plaintiff and the defendants both regarded or labelled him as a 'self-employed labour-only contractor'.  Secondly, there is the fact, and fact it is, that the plaintiff was supposed to pay his own insurance stamp as a self-employed person; that his wages were free of tax and that the obligation was upon him as upon a self-employed person to account to the Inland Revenue properly for tax.  But I ask this question:  When all the other indicia point to the relationship being that of master and servant, are these inconsistencies which should compel me to a contrary conclusion? It could not, as a true matter of law, be that they should so compel me".  

Then the learned judge makes reference to a case in the Queen's Bench Divisional Court and goes on:  "Nevertheless, should it lead me to that conclusion?  I think not".  Then there is a passage which I have already read but will read again:  "I accept what the parties accept, namely, the label, as a guide and no more. I regard the concept of 'the lump' in the circumstances of the present case as no more than a device which each side regarded as being capable of being put to his own advantage in a manner that I have attempted to describe earlier in this judgment, but which in reality did not affect the relationship of the parties or the performance of the substance of the contract between them".   "I therefore", says the judge, "arrive at the conclusion that this was in reality a contract of service and that the relationship of master and servant existed between the defendants and the plaintiff". 

I agree with all the judge says in that passage. 

I would dismiss the appeal. 

LORD JUSTICE LAWTON:   For many years past the building trade, and many outside it, have been familiar with phrases such as "working on the lump" or "working as a lump labour force".  The trade union movement has expressed grave concern about this method of working Parliament has had to protect the Revenue by legislation because of the difficulties which it creates in the collection of income tax: but no attempt has been made so far by statute to forbid it.  Indeed the Finance Act, 1971, recognised it as a way of working (see section 29) but put obstacles in the way of getting any fiscal benefits from it.  We were told by counsel for the defendants that this appeal was the first one, as far as he knew, which called for consideration of the legal consequences to anyone alleged to have been "working as a lump labour force" in relation to any injuries sustained whilst at work and as a result of the builder who had had the benefit of his work (I use a neutral phrase deliberately) failing to use the safeguards which he would have been obliged to use under statutory regulations for the safety of any workman employed by him.  What "working on the lump" or "as a lump working force" means must, of course, depend upon the evidence in each case.  The trial judge, however, held that both parties in this case regarded the plaintiff as a "self-employed labour-only sub-contractor". What was the legal effect of "working as a lump working force" when, as in this case, the plaintiff was taken on (again I use a neutral phrase) as a general labourer?

As a matter of law I can see no reason why a general labourer should not offer his labour on some such terms as these:  

"I do not mind what you ask me to do or where and when you ask me to do it hut you must understand that I am not going to call you master and I will not be your servant".  

Many men offer their labour on some such terms as these:  the jobbing gardener is familiar to us all, as are self-employed farm workers to East Anglian farmers.  When working they allow themselves to be controlled by those with whom they have made a bargain.  In most cases when the bargain is made nothing is said about control; but it is accepted by both parties as an implied term that the hirer will exercise control.  This does not mean either in fact or, in my opinion, in law that the hired man becomes a servant.

As I understood Mr. Beldam's argument on behalf of the plaintiff, he did not challenge the general proposition which I have set out above.  His case was that on the evidence the plaintiff did agree to work as the defendants' servant.  Mr, Popplewell's argument was that as the object of both parties to the hiring was to avoid the relationship of master and servant and the only express words of the bargain were to this effect, the implied understandings as to which party was to exercise control did not operate to destroy the object of the bargain and to override the only express term of it.

Now one thing is clear about the plaintiff's object in offering his labour to the defendants:  he did not like having income tax deducted from his earnings and wanted to avoid, maybe evade, paying any more tax than he had to do.  He was no twentieth century John Philpott Curran maintaining eternal vigilance to safeguard the right of individuals to be self-employed.  He must have known all about the deduction of income tax from earnings and the payment as an employed person of National Insurance contributions.  For many years he had been employed as a general labourer by builders.  The employer he had had for six years before he started work with the defendants had deducted tax from his earnings and had stamped his National Insurance card.  After leaving this employer and returning from a short visit to Ireland the plaintiff was unemployed for about a fortnight.  Pour of his friends were then working "on the lump" for the defendants.  They asked their foreman, a Mr. Murray, if he would take on the plaintiff.  He said he would.  Soon afterwards the plaintiff came along to the defendants to start work.  He spoke to Mr. Murray.  Prom the trial judge's findings I infer that he told Mr. Murray that his name was G-off.  There can only have been one reason for doing this, namely, to make the task of the Inland Revenue in tracing him more difficult.  Had I been sitting in another jurisdiction and the plaintiff had been charged before me with some offence concerned with the fraudulent evasion of tax, I should have had no hesitation in adjudging that his giving a false name was strong evidence of intending to evade fraudulently the payment of tax.  But, as Mr. Beldam pointed out, the plaintiff has not been charged with the fraudulent evasion of tax, and although the trial judge found that by giving a false name he was "a willing and dishonest party to a device to evade his tax liabilities", this had never been put to him in the witness-box so that he had never had an opportunity of meeting this allegation.  With some reluctance I felt bound to accept this submission, with the result that I have had to approach the problem presented by this appeal on the basis that the plaintiff intended to order his working relations with those who accepted his offer of work so that the tax attaching to his earnings under the appropriate Acts was less than it otherwise would have been.

There can be no doubt what the defendants' intention was.  Mr. Murray, whose evidence seems to have been accepted on this point, and generally, said:  "But I did inform him that there were no cards; we were purely working as a lump labour force".  The defendants could properly use independent sub-contractors. This is common in the building trade, and when skilled craftsmen are used, in most cases, if not all, there can be no doubt that such men are working as independent contractors.  The taking on of genuine independent sub-contractors provides builders with a number of administrative and fiscal advantages.  They are spared the task of accounting to the Inland Revenue for tax deducted from earnings and do not have to pay out money for the employer's contribution to National Insurance, In addition, when in 1972 the plaintiff was working for them they did not have to pay Selective Employment Tax.  Clearly Mr. Murray wanted to get these benefits for the defendants.

It follows that both parties to the labour bargain which was made in this case wanted to order their affairs so as. to avoid the incidence of taxation.  They could only succeed in doing so, however, if they avoided bringing into existence the relationship of master and servant.  This comes about because of the provisions of section 181 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act, 1970.  As is common knowledge, assessment for tax under Schedule D, which applies to the self-employed, gives small tax advantages which those assessed under Schedule E do not enjoy.  It is unnecessary to state what they are; but as every judge who has had experience of the criminal courts knows, and probably most of the public nowadays, it is not these advantages which attract many men who work "on the lump" but the opportunities for the evasion of tax which Schedule D provides. Section 181 (1) of the 1970 Act is in these terms:  "Schedule E. 1. Tax under this Schedule shall be charged in respect of any office or employment on emoluments therefrom...."  Section 204 (1) imposes upon any person who makes a payment of income assessable to tax under Schedule E the duty to deduct income tax.  Neither the plaintiff nor the defendants wanted these provisions to apply and they could only legally and effectively bring this about by agreeing that the defendants would not employ the plaintiff.  Assuming, as I must for the purposes of this appeal, that the parties were not conspiring with each other to evade tax fraudulently, this is what they thought they had done.  The defendants acted as if they had attained their objective.  They did not deduct tax until they were obliged to do so under the Finance Act, 1972, section 28.

If the avoidance of the relationship of master and servant was the prime object of the bargain, as I find it was from the circumstances in which it was made and the few words used, then I can see nothing in the implied terms which is inconsistent with this object. As I said at the beginning of this judgment, I can see no reason why in law a man cannot sell his labour without becoming another man's servant even though he is willing to accept control as to how, when and where he shall work.  If he makes his intention not to be a servant sufficiently clear, the implications which would normally arise from implied terms do not override the prime object of the bargain.  In my judgment this is just such a case.

I appreciate that there are powerful arguments for thinking that "working on the lump" is socially undesirable and that many men who do so work do not appreciate that they may be depriving themselves of safeguards which statutory regulations enact must be provided for employed men; but these considerations are not sufficiently strong to make labour bargains of this kind void as being against public policy.  If in a particular case the evidence leaves the court in doubt as to what the parties had agreed, there would, no doubt, be a finding which was more in accordance with public policy than against it.  That is not this case.  In my judgment there is no doubt what the parties intended and it was that the plaintiff should not be a servant of the defendants.  Anyway public policy is an awkward horse for a judge to ride, particularly when it wants to go in more than one direction.  Maybe the law should try to save workmen from their folly; but it should not encourage them to change a status which they have freely chosen when it suits them to do so.  In my judgment it would be contrary to public policy to allow a man to say he was self-employed for the purpose of avoiding the incidence of taxation but a servant for the purpose of claiming compensation.  For these reasons I would allow the appeal.

In coming to this conclusion I have not overlooked the decisions in Global Plant Ltd, v. Secretary of State for Social Services (1972) 1 Queen's Bench 139, Market Investigations v. Minister of Social Security (1969) 2 Queen's Bench 173 and Construction Industry Training Board v. Labour Force ltd. (1970) 3 All England Reports 220.  The first two were appeals by way of Case Stated, the last from a decision of the Industrial Tribunal.  In all three cases the appellate courts were concerned with deciding whether there had been errors in law.  This Court has a wider jurisdiction and is entitled to consider all the evidence given in the trial court.  That I have done and to that evidence I have sought to apply the principles which were discussed in these three cases.  In the enunciation of principle I found them helpful; but in the application of principle in the special jurisdiction with which these cases were concerned I got no help from them.

As I understand the law there is no single test for deciding whether a man is a servant of another.  Various factors have to be considered and weighed.  Control of working is one; intention is another; carrying on business on one's own account is a third.  The label which the parties attach to a bargain is not to be disregarded but it is far from being conclusive.  It was after considering and weighing these factors that I adjudged that the parties' intention to avoid the relationship of master and servant was the predominating and all-important factor.  I was helped in this decision by Mr. Beldam's acceptance that the bargain which the parties made was not a sham.

I should add that I agree with the judgment of Lord Justice Megaw on all the remaining points in this appeal. 

LORD JUSTICE BROWNE:   I agree with Lord Justice Megaw that this appeal should "be dismissed.  As to the "working place" point, I have nothing to add.  If Lord Justice Lawton did not think differently on the "employment" point, I should be content to say that I agree with Lord Justice Megaw for the reasons he has given and for the reasons given "by Mr. Justice Boreham in the passage at pages 43-44 of the transcript of his judgment which Lord Justice Megaw has read, hut as it is I think I should state my own reasons, even though they are really the same as those already given by Lord Justice Megaw.

As I understand it, Lord Justice Lawton's reasons for holding that the relationship of master and servant did not exist between the plaintiff and the defendants are:

(a)	Both parties wanted to order their affairs so as to avoid the incidence of taxation.
(b)	They could only succeed in doing this if they avoided bringing into existence the relationship of master and servant between them (see Income and Corporation Taxes Act, 1970, sections 181 (1) and 204 (1).
(c)	The avoidance of the relationship of master and servant was "the prime object of the bargain".
(d)	If the intention not to create the relationship of master and servant is sufficiently clear from the circumstances and the express words used, implications which would normally arise from implied terms do not override the prime object of the bargain.

If Lord Justice Lawton's view is right, I think it must follow that Global Plant Ltd. v. Secretary of State for Social Services (1972) 1 Queen's Bench 139 was wrongly decided.  In that case it had been expressly agreed between Global Plant and the man in question (supported by a written document) that he should be a self-employed sub-contractor, that tax should not be deducted by Global Plant, and that he should stamp his own insurance card (see pages 142/C-H and 148/E-149/D).  In spite of this, Lord Widgery, Chief Justice, held that the Secretary of State was not wrong in law in holding that, having regard to the other factors in that case, the relationship was that of master and servant (see page 152/D-E, which Lord Justice Megaw has already quoted, and pages 152-155).  I think it would probably also follow that the decision of the Divisional Court in Maurice Graham Ltd. v. Brunswick (1974) 16 Knight's Industrial Reports 153 was wrong, as Mr. Popplewell submitted.  These two cases are not binding on this Court, but in my view they were rightly decided, supported as I think they are by earlier authorities, including Ready Mixed Concrete (South East) Ltd. v. Minister of Pensions and National Insurance (1968) 2 Queen's Bench 497 and Market Investigations Ltd. v. Minister of Social Security (1969) 2 Queen's Bench 173.

Even if the "prime object of the bargain" between the plaintiff and the defendants in the present case was the avoidance of the relationship of master and servant, the question is whether they succeeded in that object.  The parties cannot by a label decide the true nature of their relationship (see especially the passage from Addiscombe Garden Estates v. Crabbe (1958) 1 Queen's Bench 513 which Lord Justice Megaw has quoted).  But I am afraid that I cannot agree with Lord Justice Lawton that this was the prime object of the bargain.  The prime object, I think, was that the plaintiff should work as a general labourer on sites where the defendants were carrying on their business as building contractors.  It is true that both parties intended that it was to be a term of the bargain that the defendants should not deduct tax and should not pay for the plaintiff's National Insurance stamps, but this was only one term.  I agree with Lord Justice Megaw that there must have been - and were - other terms, and that the court must look at the arrangements as a whole to decide what the real relationship was.

On the "basis of the single sentence in Mr. Murray's evidence which Lord Justice Megaw has quoted, Mr. Justice Boreham found that "the plaintiff and the defendants regarded the plaintiff as 'self-employed labour-only sub-contractor'" (transcript of judgment page 36).  I am not sure that I should have given that sentence such a wide and important effect.  The only evidence about what is meant by "being on the lump" was four questions and answers in the cross-examination of the plaintiff (page 7/A-B) and three in the re-examination of Mr. Murray (page 28/E-E).  The plaintiff said that it means that the employer does not deduct tax and the man stamps his own card, and Mr, Murray went no further; I doubt if either of them intended or understood what Mr. Murray said to mean more than that. But, like Lord Justice Megaw, I am prepared to assume that the judge's interpretation is right.  Even making this assumption, I agree with Lord Justice Megaw that this appeal fails, for the following reasons:

(1)	The term as to tax and stamps cannot have been the only term of the contract: as Lord Justice Megaw has pointed out, there would have been no contract at all unless there were other terms, tacitly understood, or "implied" in the sense explained by Lord Justice Megaw, and by Lord Wilberforce in the speech he has quoted,
(2)	Miller v, Whitworth Street Estates (1970) Appeal Cases 583 and E.L. Schuler A.G. v. Wickman Machine Tool Sales Ltd. (1974) Appeal Cases 235 are irrelevant.  Those cases were concerned with the construction of written contracts; the rule that "it is not legitimate to use as an aid in the construction of the contract anything which the parties said or did after it was made" (Lord Reid in Miller at page 603/E) is only a particular application of "the general rule....that extrinsic evidence is not admissible for the construction of a written contract; the parties' intentions must be ascertained, on legal principles of construction, from the words they have used" (Lord Wilberforce in Schuler at page 261/B; on this point he agreed with the other members of the House, though he dissented on another point).  In the present case, the question is not one of the construction of the contract, but what were the terms of an oral and only partially expressed contract.  In my opinion, the court can in such a ease take into account what was done later as a basis for inferring what was agreed when the contract was made, or as establishing later additions or variations.  But I do not think this point arises in the present case, because I agree with Lord Justice Megaw that Mr. Murray's evidence related to what was understood by both parties at the time when the contract was made.  I need not set out that evidence or analyse it again, because I entirely agree with Lord Justice Megaw's statement of its effect. 

(3)	 I agree with Lord Justice Megaw and Mr. Justice Boreham that on the tests laid down by the authorities the evidence establishes beyond doubt that in reality the contract between the plaintiff and the defendants was a contract of service and their relationship was that of master and servant.  The Market Investigations case (1969) 2 Queen's Bench 173 does not seem to have been cited to Mr. Justice Boreham, but I think that the application of the test suggested by Mr. Justice Cooke in that case at page 184/G-H (which I find very helpful) strongly supports his conclusion.  After quoting Lord Wright, Lord Denning and the Supreme Court of the United States, Mr. Justice Cooke said that these observations "suggest that the fundamental test to be applied is this:  'Is the person who has engaged himself to perform these services performing them as a person in business on his own account?'.   If the answer is 'Yes', then the contract is a contract for services.  If the answer is 'No', then the contract is a contract of service".  On this test, the distinction between the plaintiff in the present case and the jobbing gardener is plain,

(4)	I agree with Lord Justice Megaw that a declaration by the parties ought to be disregarded if the remainder of the contractual terms show that the reality of the relationship is one of master and servant, but, like him, I am prepared to assume that the less stringent view adopted by the authorities is right - namely, that it is a relevant, but certainly not a conclusive, factor.

(5)	In my judgment, Mr. Justice Boreham directed himself rightly in law, subject to the additional test suggested by Mr. Justice Cooke to which I have referred and to (4) above; the omission of these factors makes the tests he applied more and not less favourable to the defendants.   When the right tests have been applied, the conclusion to be drawn is in my view a question of fact - see Global Plant (1972) 1 Queen's Bench at pages 152-155.   The appellants have entirely failed to satisfy me that Mr, Justice Boreham's conclusion, stated at pages 43-44 of his judgment, was wrong; in my judgment it was right.

As I have said, I would dismiss this appeal.

Mr. Beldam:

LORD JUSTICE CAIRNS: I will ask Scarman L.J. to deliver the first judgment.
LORD JUSTICE SCARMAN: The deceased, Dennis Albert Constance was a wage earner living in Cheltenham until he died on March 9, 1974. He was married to Bridget Frances Constance, the defendant in this action. But they parted in June 1965. In 1967 the deceased met Mrs. Doreen Grace Paul who is the plaintiff in this action. The two of them set up house together in December 1967 and they lived to all appearances as man and wife up to the date of the deceased's death. The house in which they lived was 42, Larput Place, St. Pauls, Cheltenham and it was the property of the plaintiff.
In August 1969, the deceased, who was employed as a fitter in or near Cheltenham, was injured at his work. He claimed damages against his employers and ultimately, in early 1973, after he had initiated legal proceedings, his claim was disposed of by the payment to him of a sum of £950. This money he received by cheque early in 1973. He discussed with the plaintiff what to do with the money, and the evidence is clear that they decided that it was to go into a bank account. The two of them went to see the manager of the St. George's Square branch of Lloyds Bank in Cheltenham, and there they had a discussion about opening a bank account. According to the notes of evidence which the judge made, the two of them had a discussion with the bank manager. He explained to them the different sorts of accounts which they could open and the decision was taken to open a deposit account. At that stage the deceased revealed that they were not married. It is perhaps of some significance in understanding this interview if one recalls the evidence that was given by a Mr. Thomas, a fellow employee of the deceased, who said that he knew that the deceased and the plaintiff were not married, but most people did not. After the deceased had told the manager that they were not married, the manager said, "Well, it will be in your name only then?" The deceased then said, "Yes," and asked the manager what was to happen if the plaintiff wanted to draw on the account, or if he wanted her to draw on it. The manager said that that could be done if the plaintiff used a note with the deceased's signature on it, authorising her to draw on the account.
The account that was opened on that day in February 1973 is at the very heart of this case. The account was maintained in the deceased's name from that date until the date of his death. Over the period between 1973 and his death, some 13 months later in 1974, further sums were paid into the account, including, in particular, some sums which represented "bingo" winnings. It is clear from the evidence that the deceased and the plaintiff did play "bingo" and they played it really as a joint venture. They did have winnings from time to time and at any rate three of such winnings, -- none of them very great -- were paid into the account. It is clear from the plaintiff's evidence that they thought of those winnings, as "their winnings": neither hers nor his alone, but theirs. Nevertheless, when the account was closed on the deceased's death, the ultimate balance, after the addition of interest, consisted largely of the initial sum of £950 representing the deceased's damages as a result of his injury at work. There was one withdrawal during this period, a sum of £150, and the evidence is that that money was divided between the two of them after part of it had been used for buying Christmas presents and some food.
The plaintiff began her action after the deceased's death against his lawful wife, the defendant, who took out letters of administration for his estate, since he died intestate. The plaintiff claims in the action that the hank account in the deceased's name, to which I have referred, was held by him on trust for the benefit of himself and the plaintiff jointly. She claims that it was an express trust declared orally by him on numerous occasions. The defendant, as administratrix, closed the account and she maintains that the whole fund contained in the account was the beneficial property of the deceased at the time of his death and, as such, became part of his estate after death.
The matter came on for trial before Judge Rawlins in August 1975 and on August 12 the judge found in favour of the plaintiff. He found the existence of an express trust, a trust for the benefit of the plaintiff and the deceased jointly, and he ordered that the sum of £499.21 be paid to the plaintiff as representing one half-share of the fund to which she was beneficially entitled.
A number of issues were canvassed at the trial, but the only point taken by the defendant on her appeal to this court goes to the question whether or not there was, in the circumstances of this case, an express declaration of trust. It is conceded that, if there was, the trust would be enforceable. The one question is whether there was an express declaration of trust.
The case has been argued with great skill and ability by counsel on both sides and I should like to express my appreciation for the way in which Mr. Blythe, for the defendant, opened the appeal and the way in which Mr. Wilson very shortly and vigorously, put his contentions on behalf of the plaintiff/respondant.
Mr. Blythe drew the attention of the court to the so-called three certainties that have to be established before the court can infer the creation of a trust. He referred us to 27th edition of Snell , page 111, in which the three certainties are set out. We are concerned only with the first of the three certainties and it is this: "The words" -- that is the words of the declaration relied on -- "must be so used that on the whole they ought to be construed as imperative ... No particular form of expression is necessary for the creation of a trust, if on the whole it can be gathered that a trust was intended. 'A trust may well be created, although there may be an absence of any expression of terms imposing confidence.' A trust may thus be created without using the word 'trust,' for what the court regards is the substance and effect of the words used."
Mr. Blythe has taken the court through the detailed evidence and submits that one cannot find anywhere in the history of events a declaration of trust in the sense of finding the deceased saying: "I am now disposing of my interest in this fund so that you, Mrs. Paul, now have a beneficial interest in it." Of course, the words which I have just used are stilted lawyers' language and Mr. Wilson, for the plaintiff, was right to remind the court that we are dealing with simple people, unaware of the subtleties of equity, but understanding very well indeed their own domestic situation. It is, of course, right that one should consider the various things that were said and done by the plaintiff and the deceased during their time together against their own background and in their own circumstances.
Mr. Blythe drew our attention to two cases, both of them well enough known, (at any rate in Lincoln's Inn, since they have been in the law reports for over 100 years), and he relies on them as showing that, though a man may say in clear and unmistakable terms that he intends to make a gift to some other person, for instance, his child or some other member of his family, yet that does not necessarily disclose a declaration of trust. Indeed, in the two cases to which we have been referred the court held that, though there was a plain intention to make a gift, it was not right to infer any intention to create a trust.
In the first of the two cases, Jones v-. Lock (1 Ch. A. 25). Mr. Jones, returning home from a business trip to Birmingham, was scolded for not having brought anything back for his baby son. He went upstairs and came down with a cheque made out in his own name for £900 and said in the presence of his wife and the nurse: "Look you here, I give this to baby," and he then placed the cheque in the baby's hand. It was obvious that he was intending to make a gift of the cheque to his baby son, but it was clear, as Lord Cranworth held, that there was no effective gift then and there made of the cheque: it was in his name and had not been endorsed over to the baby. Other evidence showed that Mr. Jones had in mind to go and see his solicitor, Mr. Lock, to make proper provision for the baby boy, but unfortunately he died before he could do so. Jones v-. Lock was a classic case where the intention to make a gift failed because the gift was imperfect. So an attempt was made to say: "Well, since the gift was imperfect, nevertheless, one clan infer the existence of a trust." But Lord Cranworth  would have none of it.
In the second case to which Mr. Blythe referred us, Richards v-. Delbridge (18 Equity Cases p. 11) the facts were that Mr. Richards, who employed a member of his family called Edward in his business, was minded to give the business to the young man. He evidenced his intention to make this gift by endorsing on the lease of the business premises a short memorandum to the effect: "This deed" -- that is the deed of leasehold -- "and all thereto belonging I give to Edward from this time forth with all the stock in trade." 
Sir George Jessel, Master of the Rolls, who decided the case, said that there was in that case the intention to make a gift, but the gift failed because it was imperfect; and he refused to draw from the circumstances of the imperfect gift the inference of the existence of a declaration of trust or the intention to create one. The ratio decidendi appears clearly from the report. It is a short passage and because of its importance I quote it. Sir George Jessel said:
"In Milroy v. Lord (1862) 4 De G.F. & J. 264 Turner L.J. after referring to the two modes of making a voluntary settlement valid and effectual, adds these words: 'The cases, I think, go further, to this extent, that if the settlement is intended to be effectuated by one of the modes to which I have referred, the court will not give effect to it by applying another of those modes. If it is intended to take effect by transfer, the court will not hold the intended transfer to operate as a declaration of trust, for then every imperfect instrument would be made effectual by being converted into a perfect trust.' It appears to me that that sentence contains the whole law on the subject."
There is no suggestion of a gift by transfer in the present case. The facts of the two cases do not, therefore, very much help the submission of Mr. Blythe but he was able to extract from them this principle: that there must be a clear declaration of trust and that means there must be clear evidence from what is said or done of an intention to create a trust -- or, as Mr. Blythe put it, "an intention to dispose of a property or a fund so that somebody else to the exclusion of the disponent acquires the beneficial interest in it." He submitted that there was no such evidence.
When one looks at the detailed evidence to see whether it goes as far as that -- and I think that the evidence does have to go as far as that -- one finds that from the time that the deceased received his damages right up to his death he was saying, on occasions, that the money was as much the plaintiff's as his. When they discussed the damages, how to invest them or what to do with them and when they discussed the bank account, he would say to her: "The money is as much yours as mine."
The learned judge, rightly treating the basic problem in the case as a question of fact, reached this conclusion. He said: 
"I have read through my notes and I am quite satisfied that it was the intention of Mrs. Paul and Mr. Constance to create a trust in which both of them were interested."
In this court the issue becomes: was there sufficient evidence to justify the judge in reaching that conclusion of fact? In submitting that there was, Mr. Wilson draws attention first and foremost to the words used. When one bears in mind the unsophisticated character of the deceased and his relationship with the plaintiff during the last few years or his life, Mr. Wilson submits that the words that he did use on more than one occasion, "This money is as much yours as mine," convey clearly a present declaration that the existing fund was as much the plaintiff's as his own. The judge accepted that conclusion. I think that he was well justified in doing so and, indeed, I think that he was right to do so. There are, as Mr. Wilson reminded us, other features in the history of the relationship between the plaintiff and the deceased which support the interpretation of those words as an express declaration of trust. I have already described the interview with the bank manager when the account was opened. I have mentioned also the putting of the "bingo" winnings into the account and the one withdrawal for the benefit of both of them.
It might, however, be thought that this was a borderline case, since it is not easy to pin-point a specific moment of declaration, and one must exclude from one's mind any case built upon the existence of an implied or constructive trust, for this case was put forward at the trial and is now argued by the plaintiff as one of express declaration of trust. It was so pleaded and it is only as such that it may be considered in this court. The question, therefore, is whether, in all the circumstances, the use of those words on numerous occasions as between the deceased and the plaintiff constituted an express declaration of trust. The judge found that they did. For myself, I think that he was right so to find. I therefore would dismiss the appeal.
LORD JUSTICE BRIDGE: I agree. In delivering his judgment in Richards v-. Delbridge (18 Equity Cases p. 11) Sir George Jessel, Master of the Rolls, discussing the requisities of a valid declaration of trust, said:
"It is true he need not use the words 'I declare myself a trustee,' but he must do something which is equivalent to it, and use expressions which have that meaning, for, however anxious the court may be to carry out a man's intentions, it is not at liberty to construe words otherwise than according to their proper meaning." 
The plaintiff gave evidence, which the judge accepted, that on frequent occasions the deceased told her that the money in his deposit account at Lloyds Bank was as much her money as his. In the last analysis, accordingly, the whole question in this case, as it seems to me, is whether the judge was right, construing those words according to their proper meaning and in the context in which the words were spoken as disclosed by the evidence, to conclude that, by using those words, the deceased had done something which was equivalent to declaring himself a trustee of the moneys in the account for himself and the plaintiff in equal shares.
For the reasons given by Scarman L.J., I think that the judge was right in coming to that conclusion and I too would dismiss the appeal.
LORD JUSTICE CAIRNS: I agree.

LORD JUSTICE CAIRNS: I will ask Scarman L.J. to deliver the first judgment.
LORD JUSTICE SCARMAN: The deceased, Dennis Albert Constance was a wage earner living in Cheltenham until he died on March 9, 1974. He was married to Bridget Frances Constance, the defendant in this action. But they parted in June 1965. In 1967 the deceased met Mrs. Doreen Grace Paul who is the plaintiff in this action. The two of them set up house together in December 1967 and they lived to all appearances as man and wife up to the date of the deceased's death. The house in which they lived was 42, Larput Place, St. Pauls, Cheltenham and it was the property of the plaintiff.
In August 1969, the deceased, who was employed as a fitter in or near Cheltenham, was injured at his work. He claimed damages against his employers and ultimately, in early 1973, after he had initiated legal proceedings, his claim was disposed of by the payment to him of a sum of £950. This money he received by cheque early in 1973. He discussed with the plaintiff what to do with the money, and the evidence is clear that they decided that it was to go into a bank account. The two of them went to see the manager of the St. George's Square branch of Lloyds Bank in Cheltenham, and there they had a discussion about opening a bank account. According to the notes of evidence which the judge made, the two of them had a discussion with the bank manager. He explained to them the different sorts of accounts which they could open and the decision was taken to open a deposit account. At that stage the deceased revealed that they were not married. It is perhaps of some significance in understanding this interview if one recalls the evidence that was given by a Mr. Thomas, a fellow employee of the deceased, who said that he knew that the deceased and the plaintiff were not married, but most people did not. After the deceased had told the manager that they were not married, the manager said, "Well, it will be in your name only then?" The deceased then said, "Yes," and asked the manager what was to happen if the plaintiff wanted to draw on the account, or if he wanted her to draw on it. The manager said that that could be done if the plaintiff used a note with the deceased's signature on it, authorising her to draw on the account.
The account that was opened on that day in February 1973 is at the very heart of this case. The account was maintained in the deceased's name from that date until the date of his death. Over the period between 1973 and his death, some 13 months later in 1974, further sums were paid into the account, including, in particular, some sums which represented "bingo" winnings. It is clear from the evidence that the deceased and the plaintiff did play "bingo" and they played it really as a joint venture. They did have winnings from time to time and at any rate three of such winnings, -- none of them very great -- were paid into the account.

The plaintiff claims in the action that the hank account in the deceased's name, to which I have referred, was held by him on trust for the benefit of himself and the plaintiff jointly. She claims that it was an express trust declared orally by him on numerous occasions. The defendant, as administratrix, closed the account and she maintains that the whole fund contained in the account was the beneficial property of the deceased at the time of his death and, as such, became part of his estate after death.

It is conceded that, if there was, the trust would be enforceable. The one question is whether there was an express declaration of trust.

Mr. Blythe drew our attention to two cases, both of them well enough known, (at any rate in Lincoln's Inn, since they have been in the law reports for over 100 years), and he relies on them as showing that, though a man may say in clear and unmistakable terms that he intends to make a gift to some other person, for instance, his child or some other member of his family, yet that does not necessarily disclose a declaration of trust. Indeed, in the two cases to which we have been referred the court held that, though there was a plain intention to make a gift, it was not right to infer any intention to create a trust.
In the first of the two cases, Jones v-. Lock (1 Ch. A. 25). Mr. Jones, returning home from a business trip to Birmingham, was scolded for not having brought anything back for his baby son. He went upstairs and came down with a cheque made out in his own name for £900 and said in the presence of his wife and the nurse: "Look you here, I give this to baby," and he then placed the cheque in the baby's hand. It was obvious that he was intending to make a gift of the cheque to his baby son, but it was clear, as Lord Cranworth held, that there was no effective gift then and there made of the cheque: it was in his name and had not been endorsed over to the baby. Other evidence showed that Mr. Jones had in mind to go and see his solicitor, Mr. Lock, to make proper provision for the baby boy, but unfortunately he died before he could do so. Jones v-. Lock was a classic case where the intention to make a gift failed because the gift was imperfect. So an attempt was made to say: "Well, since the gift was imperfect, nevertheless, one clan infer the existence of a trust." But Lord Cranworth  would have none of it.
In the second case to which Mr. Blythe referred us, Richards v-. Delbridge (18 Equity Cases p. 11) the facts were that Mr. Richards, who employed a member of his family called Edward in his business, was minded to give the business to the young man. He evidenced his intention to make this gift by endorsing on the lease of the business premises a short memorandum to the effect: "This deed" -- that is the deed of leasehold -- "and all thereto belonging I give to Edward from this time forth with all the stock in trade." 
Sir George Jessel, Master of the Rolls, who decided the case, said that there was in that case the intention to make a gift, but the gift failed because it was imperfect; and he refused to draw from the circumstances of the imperfect gift the inference of the existence of a declaration of trust or the intention to create one. The ratio decidendi appears clearly from the report. It is a short passage and because of its importance I quote it. Sir George Jessel said:
"In Milroy v. Lord (1862) 4 De G.F. & J. 264 Turner L.J. after referring to the two modes of making a voluntary settlement valid and effectual, adds these words: 'The cases, I think, go further, to this extent, that if the settlement is intended to be effectuated by one of the modes to which I have referred, the court will not give effect to it by applying another of those modes. If it is intended to take effect by transfer, the court will not hold the intended transfer to operate as a declaration of trust, for then every imperfect instrument would be made effectual by being converted into a perfect trust.' It appears to me that that sentence contains the whole law on the subject."
There is no suggestion of a gift by transfer in the present case. The facts of the two cases do not, therefore, very much help the submission of Mr. Blythe but he was able to extract from them this principle: that there must be a clear declaration of trust and that means there must be clear evidence from what is said or done of an intention to create a trust -- or, as Mr. Blythe put it, "an intention to dispose of a property or a fund so that somebody else to the exclusion of the disponent acquires the beneficial interest in it." He submitted that there was no such evidence.
When one looks at the detailed evidence to see whether it goes as far as that -- and I think that the evidence does have to go as far as that -- one finds that from the time that the deceased received his damages right up to his death he was saying, on occasions, that the money was as much the plaintiff's as his. When they discussed the damages, how to invest them or what to do with them and when they discussed the bank account, he would say to her: "The money is as much yours as mine."
The learned judge, rightly treating the basic problem in the case as a question of fact, reached this conclusion. He said: 
"I have read through my notes and I am quite satisfied that it was the intention of Mrs. Paul and Mr. Constance to create a trust in which both of them were interested."
In this court the issue becomes: was there sufficient evidence to justify the judge in reaching that conclusion of fact? In submitting that there was, Mr. Wilson draws attention first and foremost to the words used. When one bears in mind the unsophisticated character of the deceased and his relationship with the plaintiff during the last few years or his life, Mr. Wilson submits that the words that he did use on more than one occasion, "This money is as much yours as mine," convey clearly a present declaration that the existing fund was as much the plaintiff's as his own. The judge accepted that conclusion. I think that he was well justified in doing so and, indeed, I think that he was right to do so. There are, as Mr. Wilson reminded us, other features in the history of the relationship between the plaintiff and the deceased which support the interpretation of those words as an express declaration of trust. I have already described the interview with the bank manager when the account was opened. I have mentioned also the putting of the "bingo" winnings into the account and the one withdrawal for the benefit of both of them.
It might, however, be thought that this was a borderline case, since it is not easy to pin-point a specific moment of declaration, and one must exclude from one's mind any case built upon the existence of an implied or constructive trust, for this case was put forward at the trial and is now argued by the plaintiff as one of express declaration of trust. It was so pleaded and it is only as such that it may be considered in this court. The question, therefore, is whether, in all the circumstances, the use of those words on numerous occasions as between the deceased and the plaintiff constituted an express declaration of trust. The judge found that they did. For myself, I think that he was right so to find. I therefore would dismiss the appeal.
LORD JUSTICE BRIDGE: I agree. In delivering his judgment in Richards v-. Delbridge (18 Equity Cases p. 11) Sir George Jessel, Master of the Rolls, discussing the requisities of a valid declaration of trust, said:
"It is true he need not use the words 'I declare myself a trustee,' but he must do something which is equivalent to it, and use expressions which have that meaning, for, however anxious the court may be to carry out a man's intentions, it is not at liberty to construe words otherwise than according to their proper meaning." 
The plaintiff gave evidence, which the judge accepted, that on frequent occasions the deceased told her that the money in his deposit account at Lloyds Bank was as much her money as his. In the last analysis, accordingly, the whole question in this case, as it seems to me, is whether the judge was right, construing those words according to their proper meaning and in the context in which the words were spoken as disclosed by the evidence, to conclude that, by using those words, the deceased had done something which was equivalent to declaring himself a trustee of the moneys in the account for himself and the plaintiff in equal shares.
For the reasons given by Scarman L.J., I think that the judge was right in coming to that conclusion and I too would dismiss the appeal.
LORD JUSTICE CAIRNS: I agree.
