MR JUSTICE STANLEY BURNTON:  Anthony Anderson is aged 27.  Following his plea of guilty to having committed an act outraging public decency before Hartlepool Magistrates Court he was committed to the Crown Court for sentence.  On 26th October 2007 at Teesside Crown Court he was sentenced by His Honour Judge Fox QC to three years' imprisonment.  He renews his application for leave to appeal against sentence following refusal by the single judge.

 
The victim of his conduct was a woman known as Christine Lakinski who at the relevant time was aged about 50.  She suffered from a number of complaints from birth including curvature of the spine which required her to wear a body brace throughout her teenage years.  She also had learning difficulties.  

 
In July 2007 she was living in Hartlepool.  On 26th July 2007 she left the home of a family by the name of Shotton carrying laminate flooring which they had given her.  She was seen to struggle down the street with the flooring.  She rested it against the wall of a house before steadying herself on the windowsill.  As she went to the door of the house she suddenly leant forward and her head struck the door.  Her legs gave way and she slid to the floor.  One witness, a Miss Brown, saw her head strike the concrete step with some force.  Miss Lakinski came to rest face up, prone on the pavement.  She appeared to mumble and to attempt to get to her feet.  

 
Miss Brown was concerned and telephoned her partner Simon Whitehead who was at the applicant's home.  Simon Whitehead, Scott Clements and the applicant came outside.  Clements and the applicant had been drinking.  The applicant walked over to Miss Lakinski.  He returned to his friends laughing and said that she had pissed herself.  He then went into the house and obtained a bowl of water which he then threw over Miss Lakinski.  Whitehead and Clements believed they saw Miss Lakinski's head move slightly.  The applicant was heard to say "Fucking hell, she hardly moved."  Whitehead attempted to record the incident on his mobile telephone but there was insufficient memory.  He began to delete files to make room.  

 
Clements' girlfriend and her cousin arrived.  They were told what had been going on.  They expressed disapproval and went into the house.  

 
Apparently urged on by the fact that Whitehead and Clements found his actions amusing, the applicant stated that he was going to urinate on Miss Lakinski.  Miss Brown took her 3-year-old daughter inside the house to prevent her from witnessing that.  Whitehead used his mobile telephone to record the applicant urinating over Miss Lakinski's prone body.  She remained motionless throughout.  

 
The applicant then returned to the house, collected a can of shaving foam and sprayed this over Miss Lakinski before pulling the pack of flooring over her.  Again Whitehead recorded this on his mobile telephone.  The applicant then took the mobile telephone from Whitehead and took a picture of Miss Lakinski himself.  Miss Brown said the incident lasted about 30 minutes.  

 
Miss Brown left the scene with the children and Whitehead.  She was certain that Miss Lakinski was still moving her head at this point.  The applicant and Clements went into the house and got ready to go out for the night.  When they left 20 minutes later Miss Lakinski was still lying on the pavement.  Up to this point no one had called an ambulance.  At the behest of his girlfriend and her cousin, Clements approached Miss Lakinski and shook her.  When she did not respond he telephoned for an ambulance.  The group then went out for the night without waiting for an ambulance.  At 10 pm paramedics arrived and found Miss Lakinski dead.  A post mortem revealed she had died of natural causes, namely pancreatic failure. 

 
When arrested at a club in Hartlepool the applicant said: "I saw her collapse on the floor and went over to see her.  I went back a bit after and she was covered in foam."  When interviewed he said the statement made on arrest was not true.  He said he panicked.  He knew Miss Lakinski lived nearby.  He claimed to have seen her drunk in the past.  The Shotton family said that Miss Lakinski had an occasional drink but would not have been drunk.  The applicant said he had drunk a litre of wine and half a litre of sherry which had made him merry.  He kicked the sole of Miss Lakinski's feet to rouse her.  He threw water over her head and urinated over her chest, abdomen and upper legs.  He said everyone was laughing.  He then sprayed foam on the body before getting ready to go out for the night.  

 
The judge in sentencing the applicant said that the conduct which was the subject of the charge brought shame on the people of Hartlepool, and indeed it had.  The judge said that the applicant had provided the worst and last act of oppression and invasion of the victim's personality and privacy.  The applicant had violated a woman in a dreadful way and the shocking nature of his acts over a prolonged period of time meant that a prison sentence of greater length than that indicated in a previous authority was appropriate.  Notwithstanding the credit due for the guilty plea, the applicant did not have a good character to full back on.  He had not previously been to prison but deserved the sentence which was passed.  The previous convictions of the applicant were for driving offences, failure to surrender and the invasion of duty.

 
The single judge said this on the application for leave:

 
"1.  This was a disgraceful offence which had many aggravating factors including that; (a) this offence was committed against a vulnerable lady who was lying helpless and dying on the ground; (b) you initially threw water over this lady before urinating on her; (c) not content with this, you went to collect some shaving foam, which you sprayed over this dying lady; and (d) you engaged in the appalling conduct for 30 minutes.  
2.  Even with your mitigating factors, this sentence falls within the appropriate bracket for this appalling and sustained behaviour."
Having regard to the detestable conduct which was the subject of this offence, those comments are comments with which we entirely agree.  We have taken into account the letter of the applicant dated 7th January 2008, but looking at the case as a whole we are unable to reach the conclusion that this sentence was arguably excessive and in those circumstances the renewed application is refused.

	MR JUSTICE ROYCE:  Alex James Bell is aged 25.  At South Eastern Surrey Magistrates' Court on 29th October 2007, he pleaded guilty to five offences of intentional exposure.  He was committed to the Crown Court for sentence, where he appeared on 12th December, and was sentenced to nine months' imprisonment on each count concurrent.  

 
	What had happened was this: between 27th March and 8th September 2007, he had intentionally exposed himself to five different women on five separate occasions.  Each woman was alone at the time of the offence and either walking in an alleyway, alongside a park or simply along a road.  On only one occasion, offence five, did the victim state that the appellant's penis was erect.  There were two offences where the victims were aged only 15.  It is unnecessary to recite the circumstances of each offence.  It is clear that the victims were shocked or angry and upset about what had taken place.  When in due course he was arrested, he accepted the allegations but said the offences were not sexually motivated.  

 
	The Sentencing Guidelines Council suggest that for offences of this nature, assuming no aggravating or mitigating factors, a community order is the appropriate sentence.  There is reference in the guidelines to repeat offender where it is suggested that the range of sentence should be between four weeks and 26 weeks custody.  There appears in this case to have been some discussion between counsel and the judge as to whether this offender was a repeat offender.  No conclusion was reached on that topic.  

 
	We do not consider that this appellant can properly be regarded as a repeat offender.  This was his first court appearance for any offence of this type.  

 
	We have also been referred to a decision of this court, R v Whitton [2006] EWCA Crim 3229.  That was a case in which an appellant had committed nine such offences.  Six of them involved girls under the age of 18.  He received a three year community order with a supervision requirement.  The Court of Appeal considered that that was an appropriate sentence.  

 
	We bear in mind that this appellant has already spent some time in custody, just over one month.  We reach the conclusion that a community order would have been the appropriate sentence in this case and we therefore quash the sentence of imprisonment and substitute therefore a community order with a two year supervision requirement.  The consequence of that will be that the notification requirements under the Sexual Offences Act 2003 will reduce from ten years to five years.  This appeal is accordingly allowed.

THE VICE PRESIDENT:  On 23rd April 2007 in the Crown Court at Maidstone, the two appellants were convicted of two counts of wounding with intent and four counts of attempting to inflict grievous bodily harm.  They were sentenced as far as the appellant, Bennett, was concerned to 4 years' imprisonment and as far as Turner was concerned to imprisonment for public protection with a minimum term of 30 months.  They were also disqualified from driving.

 
The charges arose out of a horrific incident of deliberate driving for the purposes of causing injury as the jury's verdict indicated.  It occurred in the early hours of 24th July 2005.  A group of young people had left a nightclub in Strood, in Kent, and eventually went to the ESSO garage in Cuxton Road where they stopped to buy something to eat.  While they were on the garage forecourt a car drove in which was occupied by four young men.  They were being loud.  There was an altercation to which we will return between one of the group of pedestrians and one of the people in the car.  The group then left the forecourt to walk along the road when, the prosecution case was, the car which had been in the garage and had been involved in the altercation, was driven deliberately onto the pavement and into the group.  The number of counts reflect the fact that the group consisted of six young people, two were significantly injured, hence two counts of wounding with intent.  The others were fortunately not seriously injured but the counts reflect what the prosecution say must have been the intent not only of the driver.  But also the passenger.  It was the prosecution case that the driver was Turner and the passenger was Bennett.

 
As far as the evidence was concerned, it consisted of the evidence of the six young people, two of whom were called to give evidence, the others were read. The position was, as far as that evidence was concerned, that at one point one of the group called Reggie Smith, one of those whose evidence was read, said that he went over to the car in the garage because he thought the front passenger was shouting at the girls in the group.  He told them he did not want any trouble and they should leave his friends alone.  The car then drove away.  Two of the witnesses who were called agreed that such an incident had occurred.

 
None of the group of pedestrians admitted to knowing any of those in the car; and after the incident there was an identification procedure, at which none of them was able to identify either of the two appellants.  The evidence against the appellants consisted almost, but not wholly entirely of the contents of an interview that the police had with a young man, Darren Jodka.  Darren Jodka was identified on a CCTV video recording by a police officer as being the front seat passenger in the car.  That television coverage was of the forecourt of the garage.  Jodka was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder and interviewed twice under caution.  During the course of those interviews, for the moment taking it shortly, he identified that at the relevant time, that is at the time the car struck the pedestrians, the car was being driven by Turner and that Bennett was the front seat passenger.

 
On that basis he was called by the prosecution as a witness, the prosecution having determined not to charge him.  At an aborted trial said that he could not remember.  At the trial with which we are concerned, he was called to give evidence and in-chief once again stated that he could not remember the events of that night.  The prosecution applied for him to be treated as hostile and the judge granted that application.  The prosecution then sought to put in the contents of the interviews under section 119 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003.  The judge, after hearing argument, concluded that the contents of the interviews were admissible under section 119.  It was then submitted on behalf of the appellant that if the contents of the interviews were admissible, nonetheless they should be excluded under section 78 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act.  The judge rejected that submission and the contents of the interviews were accordingly played to the jury.

 
At the end of the prosecution case counsel for both appellants then submitted that there was no case to answer, relying upon the well-known cases of Galbraith and Shippey, but also relying on the provisions of section 125 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003.  The judge rejected those submissions, held that there was sufficient evidence upon which a jury properly directed could convict and allowed the matter to go before the jury.

 
At this stage we should state that in addition to that evidence, that is the evidence of those statements, there were two further pieces of evidence which were of significance.  One was the evidence of a Gerald McKenna, which was also read to the jury, in circumstances with which we are not concerned, and that evidence was to the effect that he had bought the car, which was clearly identified as the car in the incident, in mid July 2005, and that on the evening of 23rd July 2005, that is the evening of the night on which the incident occurred, he had lent that car to the appellant, Bennett, whom he had known for a few months.  The following day the appellant, Bennett, told him that the car had been stolen.

 
The second material part of the evidence was the evidence of two witnesses who were also pedestrians in the area at the time, one was Steve Nifton.  He was with a friend, Shane Burke and another, when they saw a car, which accorded with the description of the car which had been owned by Gerald McKenna, driving round in Cuxton Road.  The people in the car were shouting as if they were looking for trouble.  The next time he saw the car, he said minutes later, it had stopped and all four doors were open and the occupants appeared to change seats.  It drove back to the roundabout and then he saw it eventually revving its engine, mounting the pavement in front of him and driving into the group which was the group of pedestrians who were hit by the car.  The evidence of Shane Burke and his friend was also read.  They said that when the car stopped in front of them, they saw one of the back seat passengers get out and swap places with the driver and the other back seat passenger swapped places with the front passenger.   

 
The jury, on the basis of that evidence, the detail of the evidence of Jodka we will return to, convicted the appellants after they themselves had not given evidence, and after a summing-up terms about which no complaint could possibly be nor has been made.

 
The essential grounds of appeal relate to the fact that the judge permitted the evidence of the interviews of Jodka to be put before the jury.  Further it is said that even if he was correct in permitting them to go before the jury, he wrongly refused to conclude that there was no case to answer, either in the Galbraith sense, or pursuant to the requirements of section 125(1) of the 2003 Act, on the grounds that the evidence was so unconvincing that any conviction of the offence would be unsafe.

 
There is no challenge to the judge's conclusion that the evidence, that is the content of the interviews, was admissible pursuant to section 119 of the 2003 Act and to put in its context it may be appropriate just to set out the terms of that section which clearly changes substantially the admissibility of previous inconsistent statements.  It provides as follows:  

 
"(1) If in criminal proceedings a person gives oral evidence and 
(a) he admits making a previous inconsistent statement, or. 
(b) a previous inconsistent statement made by him is proved by virtue of section 3, 4 or 5 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1865 (c. 18). 
the statement is admissible as evidence of any matter stated of which oral evidence by him would be admissible.
(2) If in criminal proceedings evidence of an inconsistent statement by any person is given under section 124(2)(c), the statement is admissible as evidence of any matter stated in it of which oral evidence by that person would be admissible." 
As can be appreciated, that makes a substantial change in the previous evidential position of such statements and it is, as we have indicated, accepted that the consequence was that, in the light of the fact that that the witness, Jodka, asserted that he could not remember the events of that evening, it meant that the material contained in the interviews, which set out, as we shall see, an apparently clear and coherent account of what happened that evening was properly described a "previous inconsistent statement".

 
The detail of the statement may best be set out at this stage in order to enable the arguments under section 78 and the arguments relating to the question of whether or not the matter should have been left to the jury to be properly understood.  The transcript of the relevant part of the interview reads as follows.  The reference to "Chris" will be to Turner and the reference to "Simon" will be to Bennett:   

 
"Chris said: 'Let's go to the petrol garage and get some more credit'. So we went to the petrol garage and then we pulled up just near like the cash point and Chris said: 'Oh no, don't go in there, there's a boy there there I can't... I have rows like him like... he wants to fight me.' So Danny started shouting out the window saying 'what him there wants to fight ya?' So the boys turned round, noticed it was Chris and come over to the car, opened my door.  I was in the front passenger and said: 'What do yous want?' and Chris was trying to hide in the back and said: 'You're Chris Turner ain't ya, get outta the car, I'll fight ya'.  So I said: 'Come on, let's just go'.  Boy said: 'If you don't want no petrol get out the petrol garage and go'.  So we drive off up the top of the road, got to the roundabout near Amadeus, Cuxton Road, and Chris said: 'Let me drive'.  So Chris got in the driver's seat, Simon went to get in the back.  I said: 'Oh Simon let me get in the back'.  So I got in the back, me and Danny was in the back, Simon was in the front passenger and Chris was driving.  Chris said: 'I'm gonna run him over', so we went round and Simon's going: 'Don't be silly don't be silly'.  Chris parked up on the main road on the edge and Simon said: 'Don't be silly, you can't do that' and Chris said 'No... I can't do it' so we swapped back over and we're sitting there and I said: 'Take me home Simon' and Simon said: 'We're going ....' Chris said: 'Oh fuck this let me do it'.  So they swapped back over I said 'Come on, Dan, let's get out'.  Chris said to me:  'Before I do this Del I want you to get out, coz I don't want your uncle on my back'. So I said: 'Come on Dan, let's you and me get out' and Danny said to me: 'No don't be silly, he ain't going to do it'.  So I shut the door and sat down, before I knew it, Chris started the engine up and said: 'Come on let's get home' just driv off all normal and people was walking in front of us and Chris put his foot down and just headed for the lot, and we just driv off, got back to Gravesend, Valley Drive and me and Danny said:  'Let us get out'.  Chris was saying 'No, let's just get home'.  So Danny ripped the handbrake up, we jumped out and Simon and Chris driv off.  I got to my front door, Chris phoned me up and he said: 'If you grass me up, I'm gonna do what I just did to them... I'm gonna to do what I just done to you what I just done to them.  I said 'I won't say nothing, I won't say nothing'.  He said 'You best not' and then cut the phone off and I went to bed and that was it." 
On behalf of the appellant, Bennett, Mr Lloyd submitted to the Recorder, as did Miss Ritchie on behalf of the appellant, Turner, that the circumstances were such that it could properly be said in terms of section 78 that, having regard to all the circumstances, including the circumstances in which the evidence was obtained, the omission of the evidence would have such an adverse effect on the fairness of the proceedings that the court ought not admit it.

 
They also referred the judge to section 114 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, which sets out in subsection (2), the matters to which the court must have regard, when dealing with admission of hearsay evidence.  It was submitted that in the present case the evidence was inherently unreliable given by an unreliable witness in circumstances such that the court could not properly place any reliance on it at all.  That made it a statement which should not be put before the jury as it would be prejudicial to the fairness of the trial. The basis upon which those submissions were made included the following.  Firstly, the Crown's case against each of the defendants was based wholly on the evidence of the witness who had a motive to lie; having been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder, his account was bound to be an exculpatory account in all the circumstances.  He was therefore giving an account which should not properly found the only substantial evidence against these appellants.  Secondly, Jodka was a confessed drug user.  Thirdly he was a man of bad character, indeed he was serving a prison sentence at the time.  Fourthly he was, on the prosecution's own case, a liar, in that this material was being put before the jury on the basis that he was lying when he said he could not remember.  Fifthly the evidence of what happened, according to him, at the garage, was inconsistent with the evidence of the pedestrians because his evidence suggested that at least one of the pedestrians knew the appellant, Turner, whereas none of the pedestrians admitted knowing Turner or recognising him at a later stage.  In all those circumstances, it was submitted it was wholly inappropriate to put the matter before the jury.  

 
The Recorder considered those submissions and dealt with them in detail.  It is acknowledged on behalf of both appellants that he directed himself clearly and correctly as to the provisions of section 78 and the circumstances in which that discretion should be exercised.  It is also accepted that he carefully considered the matters set out in section 114(2) of the 2003 Act which were relevant to the consideration of the exercise of his discretion.  But nonetheless the appellants submit he came clearly to the wrong conclusion.

 
We cannot see how that argument can succeed. As far as section 78 was concerned, the position was that the appellants were perfectly entitled to and able to cross-examine Jodka.  Clearly, the fact that he was purporting not to remember what happened meant that they were unable to ask him to replicate the account but that did not prevent them from putting to him their case, cross-examining in relation to the account, in relation to its internal consistencies such as they were or external inconsistencies such as they were; and of course it did not preclude them in any event from them being able to give their account, if they so wished, to the jury at a subsequent stage.  There was, it seems to us, ample material to justify the Recorder concluding that in the light of the evidence from the witness, McKenna, that the appellant, Bennett, had at the very least access to the car at the relevant time, and the evidence of the CCTV camera and the evidence of the police officer placing Jodka in the passenger seat, as he himself said in interview, and finally the evidence of the witnesses who saw what happened in the road, that is the changing places of those in the car, a matter which otherwise would only be known to those who were in the car, that the material was not so undermined by any other evidence as to suggest that it could not properly be relied on by the jury.  Further, it is important in this context, and also when we consider the later submissions in relation to leaving the matter to the jury, to recall that the jury had the benefit not merely of a transcript of the interviews, but hearing the recording of the interviews themselves from which the jury could derive at least some assistance.  The judge clearly considered that he derived assistance from it and expressly so stated.  We can see accordingly nothing in the present material before us which could justify the conclusion that the judge exercised his discretion in a way with which this Court could disagree the extent of concluding that the consequence of the admission of this evidence rendered the verdicts unsafe.

 
We turn then to the submissions made at the end of the prosecution case that the case should be withdrawn from the jury.  There is a substantial overlap between the way in which the matter was put on the basis of Galbraith, on the one hand, and section 125 on the other.  Section 125(1) provides:  

 
"(1) If on a defendant's trial before a judge and jury for an offence the court is satisfied at any time after the close of the case for the prosecution that 
(a) the case against the defendant is based wholly or partly on a statement not made in oral evidence in the proceedings, and. 
(b) the evidence provided by the statement is so unconvincing that, considering its importance to the case against the defendant, his conviction of the offence would be unsafe. 
the court must either direct the jury to acquit the defendant of the offence or, if it considers that there ought to be a retrial, discharge the jury."
This Court has considered the interrelation between those provisions and the classic submissions of no case to answer based upon Galbraith in the case of Joyce and Joyce [2005] EWCA Crim 1785, where at paragraph 19, Rose LJ, giving the judgment of this Court said: 

 
"It is submitted, and we accept, that section 125 should not be regarded as requiring a higher standard than Galbraith.  But it provides, in accordance with the Law Commission's recommendation in paragraphs 11.31 and 11.32 of their report, an additional safety valve obliging a judge to direct an acquittal where the previous statements are particularly unpersuasive."  
The point is made on behalf the appellants that we should approach this case on the basis that it is a very different case from the case of Joyce and Joyce.  Joyce and Joyce was a case involving identification.  Later on in the judgment, Rose LJ sets out the circumstances in which the identifications were made, in terms which make it clear that the identification evidence was strong.  It was a case where the statements relied upon were statements pursuant to section 9, in other words statements in which the witnesses had each indicated they were stating the truth as to the matters set out in those statements.  This case is very different.  This case is concerned with the contents of interviews where there is no statement of truth.  Finally and most important, it is submitted that this case is concerned not with three statements but one statement and one statement from a witness whose evidence has the deficiencies which were identified in the submissions relating to section 78.

 
Accordingly it is submitted on behalf of the appellants, this was clearly a case where the court should have been driven to conclude, using either the Galbraith test, or section 125, that the evidence was unconvincing.  The difference clearly between section 125 and Galbraith is that there is statutory obligation in section 125 to stop the case and that, it is submitted should have been done in this case.  It is submitted that this is the first time when such evidence has been put before the court and before a jury in a trial and that it represents a radical departure from previous practice.  We agree.  But the plain fact is that the provisions with which we are concerned in this case (essentially section 119) have undoubtedly changed the landscape of a criminal trial.  It is now possible to put before juries evidence which was previously inadmissible. That seems to us simply to be the inevitable consequence of the statutory provisions.  The protection for defendants is contained in the provisions which the appellants have prayed in aid, namely section 78 and section 125 of the 2003 Act and indeed by the fact that when considering how to approach submissions in relation to section 78 in this type of situation the court is greatly helped by the provisions of section 114(2) of the 2003 Act.  This Recorder accorded to the appellants in this case full consideration of those safeguards.  He did not, in our judgment, err his application of them.  It has to be remembered that this is not a case where the evidence of the interviews was put before the jury in a vacuum.  There was the other material to which we have referred, which was at least consistent with the basic thrust of the content of the interviews.  In those circumstances, provided that the jury was given proper warning as to how to approach this material, it seems to us that the judge was perfectly entitled to ask the jury to consider it.  It has to be remembered that in this case, apart from a written statement handed in to the police by the appellant, Bennett, which dealt, but only shortly, with the fact that he accepted that the car had been bought by his friend, Gerald McKenna, but denied that he had anything to do with the incident on the 24th and did not know what had happened to the car, these two appellants gave no account of the events that night either to the police, or to the jury.  In those circumstances, the jury were perfectly entitled to conclude that the evidence of Jodka was sufficient to satisfy them so they which were sure that the appellants were present in the car as he described.  

 
That leaves the submission on behalf of appellant, Bennett, that, even if the jury were entitled to consider the interviews, nonetheless the content of the interviews did not justify the conclusion that he was a participant in the crimes carried out by Turner.  The judge concluded for the purposes of sentencing that he was part of a joint enterprise.  He accordingly must have taken the view that the jury's verdict what was to the effect that when in the narrative given by he Jodka the appellant Bennett got out of the driver's seat on the second occasion and went to the passenger seat, leaving Turner to get into the driver's seat, he knew that Turner was intending to drive at the pedestrians or appreciated that there was a real risk that is what would happen.  It seems to us that was a perfectly permissible interpretation of the content of the interviews and the judge directed the jury impeccably as to that aspect of the case.  

 
It follows that, in our judgment, the jury were entitled to come to the conclusion that they did in relation to the guilt of the appellant, Bennett.  We accordingly dismiss these appeals.

[
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  On 23rd April 2007 in the Crown Court at Maidstone, the two appellants were convicted of two counts of wounding with intent and four counts of attempting to inflict grievous bodily harm.  They were sentenced as far as the appellant, Bennett, was concerned to 4 years' imprisonment and as far as Turner was concerned to imprisonment for public protection with a minimum term of 30 months.  They were also disqualified from driving.

 
The charges arose out of a horrific incident of deliberate driving for the purposes of causing injury as the jury's verdict indicated.  It occurred in the early hours of 24th July 2005.  A group of young people had left a nightclub in Strood, in Kent, and eventually went to the ESSO garage in Cuxton Road where they stopped to buy something to eat.  While they were on the garage forecourt a car drove in which was occupied by four young men.  They were being loud.  There was an altercation to which we will return between one of the group of pedestrians and one of the people in the car.  The group then left the forecourt to walk along the road when, the prosecution case was, the car which had been in the garage and had been involved in the altercation, was driven deliberately onto the pavement and into the group.  The number of counts reflect the fact that the group consisted of six young people, two were significantly injured, hence two counts of wounding with intent.  The others were fortunately not seriously injured but the counts reflect what the prosecution say must have been the intent not only of the driver.  But also the passenger.  It was the prosecution case that the driver was Turner and the passenger was Bennett.

 
As far as the evidence was concerned, it consisted of the evidence of the six young people, two of whom were called to give evidence, the others were read. The position was, as far as that evidence was concerned, that at one point one of the group called Reggie Smith, one of those whose evidence was read, said that he went over to the car in the garage because he thought the front passenger was shouting at the girls in the group.  He told them he did not want any trouble and they should leave his friends alone.  The car then drove away.  Two of the witnesses who were called agreed that such an incident had occurred.

 
None of the group of pedestrians admitted to knowing any of those in the car; and after the incident there was an identification procedure, at which none of them was able to identify either of the two appellants.  The evidence against the appellants consisted almost, but not wholly entirely of the contents of an interview that the police had with a young man, Darren Jodka.  Darren Jodka was identified on a CCTV video recording by a police officer as being the front seat passenger in the car.  That television coverage was of the forecourt of the garage.  Jodka was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder and interviewed twice under caution.  During the course of those interviews, for the moment taking it shortly, he identified that at the relevant time, that is at the time the car struck the pedestrians, the car was being driven by Turner and that Bennett was the front seat passenger.

 
On that basis he was called by the prosecution as a witness, the prosecution having determined not to charge him.  At an aborted trial said that he could not remember.  At the trial with which we are concerned, he was called to give evidence and in-chief once again stated that he could not remember the events of that night.  The prosecution applied for him to be treated as hostile and the judge granted that application.  The prosecution then sought to put in the contents of the interviews under section 119 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003.  The judge, after hearing argument, concluded that the contents of the interviews were admissible under section 119.  It was then submitted on behalf of the appellant that if the contents of the interviews were admissible, nonetheless they should be excluded under section 78 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act.  The judge rejected that submission and the contents of the interviews were accordingly played to the jury.

 
At the end of the prosecution case counsel for both appellants then submitted that there was no case to answer, relying upon the well-known cases of Galbraith and Shippey, but also relying on the provisions of section 125 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003.  The judge rejected those submissions, held that there was sufficient evidence upon which a jury properly directed could convict and allowed the matter to go before the jury.

 
At this stage we should state that in addition to that evidence, that is the evidence of those statements, there were two further pieces of evidence which were of significance.  One was the evidence of a Gerald McKenna, which was also read to the jury, in circumstances with which we are not concerned, and that evidence was to the effect that he had bought the car, which was clearly identified as the car in the incident, in mid July 2005, and that on the evening of 23rd July 2005, that is the evening of the night on which the incident occurred, he had lent that car to the appellant, Bennett, whom he had known for a few months.  The following day the appellant, Bennett, told him that the car had been stolen.

 
The second material part of the evidence was the evidence of two witnesses who were also pedestrians in the area at the time, one was Steve Nifton.  He was with a friend, Shane Burke and another, when they saw a car, which accorded with the description of the car which had been owned by Gerald McKenna, driving round in Cuxton Road.  The people in the car were shouting as if they were looking for trouble.  The next time he saw the car, he said minutes later, it had stopped and all four doors were open and the occupants appeared to change seats.  It drove back to the roundabout and then he saw it eventually revving its engine, mounting the pavement in front of him and driving into the group which was the group of pedestrians who were hit by the car.  The evidence of Shane Burke and his friend was also read.  They said that when the car stopped in front of them, they saw one of the back seat passengers get out and swap places with the driver and the other back seat passenger swapped places with the front passenger.   

 
The jury, on the basis of that evidence, the detail of the evidence of Jodka we will return to, convicted the appellants after they themselves had not given evidence, and after a summing-up terms about which no complaint could possibly be nor has been made.

 
The essential grounds of appeal relate to the fact that the judge permitted the evidence of the interviews of Jodka to be put before the jury.  Further it is said that even if he was correct in permitting them to go before the jury, he wrongly refused to conclude that there was no case to answer, either in the Galbraith sense, or pursuant to the requirements of section 125(1) of the 2003 Act, on the grounds that the evidence was so unconvincing that any conviction of the offence would be unsafe.

 
There is no challenge to the judge's conclusion that the evidence, that is the content of the interviews, was admissible pursuant to section 119 of the 2003 Act and to put in its context it may be appropriate just to set out the terms of that section which clearly changes substantially the admissibility of previous inconsistent statements.  It provides as follows:  

 
"(1) If in criminal proceedings a person gives oral evidence and 
(a) he admits making a previous inconsistent statement, or. 
(b) a previous inconsistent statement made by him is proved by virtue of section 3, 4 or 5 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1865 (c. 18). 
the statement is admissible as evidence of any matter stated of which oral evidence by him would be admissible.
(2) If in criminal proceedings evidence of an inconsistent statement by any person is given under section 124(2)(c), the statement is admissible as evidence of any matter stated in it of which oral evidence by that person would be admissible." 
As can be appreciated, that makes a substantial change in the previous evidential position of such statements and it is, as we have indicated, accepted that the consequence was that, in the light of the fact that that the witness, Jodka, asserted that he could not remember the events of that evening, it meant that the material contained in the interviews, which set out, as we shall see, an apparently clear and coherent account of what happened that evening was properly described a "previous inconsistent statement".

 
The detail of the statement may best be set out at this stage in order to enable the arguments under section 78 and the arguments relating to the question of whether or not the matter should have been left to the jury to be properly understood.  The transcript of the relevant part of the interview reads as follows.  The reference to "Chris" will be to Turner and the reference to "Simon" will be to Bennett:   

 
"Chris said: 'Let's go to the petrol garage and get some more credit'. So we went to the petrol garage and then we pulled up just near like the cash point and Chris said: 'Oh no, don't go in there, there's a boy there there I can't... I have rows like him like... he wants to fight me.' So Danny started shouting out the window saying 'what him there wants to fight ya?' So the boys turned round, noticed it was Chris and come over to the car, opened my door.  I was in the front passenger and said: 'What do yous want?' and Chris was trying to hide in the back and said: 'You're Chris Turner ain't ya, get outta the car, I'll fight ya'.  So I said: 'Come on, let's just go'.  Boy said: 'If you don't want no petrol get out the petrol garage and go'.  So we drive off up the top of the road, got to the roundabout near Amadeus, Cuxton Road, and Chris said: 'Let me drive'.  So Chris got in the driver's seat, Simon went to get in the back.  I said: 'Oh Simon let me get in the back'.  So I got in the back, me and Danny was in the back, Simon was in the front passenger and Chris was driving.  Chris said: 'I'm gonna run him over', so we went round and Simon's going: 'Don't be silly don't be silly'.  Chris parked up on the main road on the edge and Simon said: 'Don't be silly, you can't do that' and Chris said 'No... I can't do it' so we swapped back over and we're sitting there and I said: 'Take me home Simon' and Simon said: 'We're going ....' Chris said: 'Oh fuck this let me do it'.  So they swapped back over I said 'Come on, Dan, let's get out'.  Chris said to me:  'Before I do this Del I want you to get out, coz I don't want your uncle on my back'. So I said: 'Come on Dan, let's you and me get out' and Danny said to me: 'No don't be silly, he ain't going to do it'.  So I shut the door and sat down, before I knew it, Chris started the engine up and said: 'Come on let's get home' just driv off all normal and people was walking in front of us and Chris put his foot down and just headed for the lot, and we just driv off, got back to Gravesend, Valley Drive and me and Danny said:  'Let us get out'.  Chris was saying 'No, let's just get home'.  So Danny ripped the handbrake up, we jumped out and Simon and Chris driv off.  I got to my front door, Chris phoned me up and he said: 'If you grass me up, I'm gonna do what I just did to them... I'm gonna to do what I just done to you what I just done to them.  I said 'I won't say nothing, I won't say nothing'.  He said 'You best not' and then cut the phone off and I went to bed and that was it." 
On behalf of the appellant, Bennett, Mr Lloyd submitted to the Recorder, as did Miss Ritchie on behalf of the appellant, Turner, that the circumstances were such that it could properly be said in terms of section 78 that, having regard to all the circumstances, including the circumstances in which the evidence was obtained, the omission of the evidence would have such an adverse effect on the fairness of the proceedings that the court ought not admit it.

 
They also referred the judge to section 114 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, which sets out in subsection (2), the matters to which the court must have regard, when dealing with admission of hearsay evidence.  It was submitted that in the present case the evidence was inherently unreliable given by an unreliable witness in circumstances such that the court could not properly place any reliance on it at all.  That made it a statement which should not be put before the jury as it would be prejudicial to the fairness of the trial. The basis upon which those submissions were made included the following.  Firstly, the Crown's case against each of the defendants was based wholly on the evidence of the witness who had a motive to lie; having been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder, his account was bound to be an exculpatory account in all the circumstances.  He was therefore giving an account which should not properly found the only substantial evidence against these appellants.  Secondly, Jodka was a confessed drug user.  Thirdly he was a man of bad character, indeed he was serving a prison sentence at the time.  Fourthly he was, on the prosecution's own case, a liar, in that this material was being put before the jury on the basis that he was lying when he said he could not remember.  Fifthly the evidence of what happened, according to him, at the garage, was inconsistent with the evidence of the pedestrians because his evidence suggested that at least one of the pedestrians knew the appellant, Turner, whereas none of the pedestrians admitted knowing Turner or recognising him at a later stage.  In all those circumstances, it was submitted it was wholly inappropriate to put the matter before the jury.  

 
The Recorder considered those submissions and dealt with them in detail.  It is acknowledged on behalf of both appellants that he directed himself clearly and correctly as to the provisions of section 78 and the circumstances in which that discretion should be exercised.  It is also accepted that he carefully considered the matters set out in section 114(2) of the 2003 Act which were relevant to the consideration of the exercise of his discretion.  But nonetheless the appellants submit he came clearly to the wrong conclusion.

 
We cannot see how that argument can succeed. As far as section 78 was concerned, the position was that the appellants were perfectly entitled to and able to cross-examine Jodka.  Clearly, the fact that he was purporting not to remember what happened meant that they were unable to ask him to replicate the account but that did not prevent them from putting to him their case, cross-examining in relation to the account, in relation to its internal consistencies such as they were or external inconsistencies such as they were; and of course it did not preclude them in any event from them being able to give their account, if they so wished, to the jury at a subsequent stage.  There was, it seems to us, ample material to justify the Recorder concluding that in the light of the evidence from the witness, McKenna, that the appellant, Bennett, had at the very least access to the car at the relevant time, and the evidence of the CCTV camera and the evidence of the police officer placing Jodka in the passenger seat, as he himself said in interview, and finally the evidence of the witnesses who saw what happened in the road, that is the changing places of those in the car, a matter which otherwise would only be known to those who were in the car, that the material was not so undermined by any other evidence as to suggest that it could not properly be relied on by the jury.  Further, it is important in this context, and also when we consider the later submissions in relation to leaving the matter to the jury, to recall that the jury had the benefit not merely of a transcript of the interviews, but hearing the recording of the interviews themselves from which the jury could derive at least some assistance.  The judge clearly considered that he derived assistance from it and expressly so stated.  We can see accordingly nothing in the present material before us which could justify the conclusion that the judge exercised his discretion in a way with which this Court could disagree the extent of concluding that the consequence of the admission of this evidence rendered the verdicts unsafe.

 
We turn then to the submissions made at the end of the prosecution case that the case should be withdrawn from the jury.  There is a substantial overlap between the way in which the matter was put on the basis of Galbraith, on the one hand, and section 125 on the other.  Section 125(1) provides:  

 
"(1) If on a defendant's trial before a judge and jury for an offence the court is satisfied at any time after the close of the case for the prosecution that 
(a) the case against the defendant is based wholly or partly on a statement not made in oral evidence in the proceedings, and. 
(b) the evidence provided by the statement is so unconvincing that, considering its importance to the case against the defendant, his conviction of the offence would be unsafe. 
the court must either direct the jury to acquit the defendant of the offence or, if it considers that there ought to be a retrial, discharge the jury."
This Court has considered the interrelation between those provisions and the classic submissions of no case to answer based upon Galbraith in the case of Joyce and Joyce [2005] EWCA Crim 1785, where at paragraph 19, Rose LJ, giving the judgment of this Court said: 

 
"It is submitted, and we accept, that section 125 should not be regarded as requiring a higher standard than Galbraith.  But it provides, in accordance with the Law Commission's recommendation in paragraphs 11.31 and 11.32 of their report, an additional safety valve obliging a judge to direct an acquittal where the previous statements are particularly unpersuasive."  
The point is made on behalf the appellants that we should approach this case on the basis that it is a very different case from the case of Joyce and Joyce.  Joyce and Joyce was a case involving identification.  Later on in the judgment, Rose LJ sets out the circumstances in which the identifications were made, in terms which make it clear that the identification evidence was strong.  It was a case where the statements relied upon were statements pursuant to section 9, in other words statements in which the witnesses had each indicated they were stating the truth as to the matters set out in those statements.  This case is very different.  This case is concerned with the contents of interviews where there is no statement of truth.  Finally and most important, it is submitted that this case is concerned not with three statements but one statement and one statement from a witness whose evidence has the deficiencies which were identified in the submissions relating to section 78.

 
Accordingly it is submitted on behalf of the appellants, this was clearly a case where the court should have been driven to conclude, using either the Galbraith test, or section 125, that the evidence was unconvincing.  The difference clearly between section 125 and Galbraith is that there is statutory obligation in section 125 to stop the case and that, it is submitted should have been done in this case.  It is submitted that this is the first time when such evidence has been put before the court and before a jury in a trial and that it represents a radical departure from previous practice.  We agree.  But the plain fact is that the provisions with which we are concerned in this case (essentially section 119) have undoubtedly changed the landscape of a criminal trial.

MR JUSTICE UNDERHILL: 
There are before us two matters arising out of the 
  same background  an appeal by Mr Michael Bogdal against his conviction and 
  sentence in the Hull Crown Court for three offences under the Dangerous Dogs 
  Act 1991, and an application for judicial review of the same order of the 
  Crown Court brought by his mother, Mrs Janina Bogdal. We are dealing with the 
  former as the Court of Appeal (Criminal Division) and the latter as a 
  Divisional Court. The primary issue which we have to decide is whether the 
  location at which the offences of which Mr Bogdal was convicted was a "public 
  place" within the meaning of the Act. 

FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY
Mr Bogdal, who is aged 59, was at all material times 
  the owner of a property called Wawne House in Hull. The only person living 
  there at the material time was Mrs Bogdal, who is aged 87. Mr Bogdal does not 
  live there himself but he is there a good deal. Wawne House lies a little way 
  back from the main road with an extensive area of lawn as its front garden. In 
  what used to be its back garden is a property called Sycamore House, which is 
  a private care home for the elderly: it was built by Mr. Bogdal some years ago 
  but subsequently sold by him. A broad tarmac driveway runs in a horseshoe 
  shape to and from the road round the edge of the front garden of Wawne House 
  and around the back to Sycamore House: one limb of the horseshoe is bordered 
  by shrubs but the other is unscreened from the lawn. The driveway constitutes 
  the main means of access to both buildings and may be used by any person with 
  legitimate occasion to visit either Wawne House or Sycamore House. It is not a 
  public right of way. There are no gates where the driveway meets the road, but 
  there is a large sign for Sycamore House at the principal opening. 

On three occasions in the summer of 2005 visitors 
  walking on the shared driveway were attacked and bitten by an Alsatian dog. 
  The first occasion was on 29th May. The victim was a Ms Bowering, 
  who was going to visit her mother, a resident in Sycamore House. She was on a 
  bicycle. The dog was tethered to a rope which was attached to a stake driven 
  into the lawn in front of Wawne House; but the rope was not short enough to 
  prevent it from attacking her on the driveway. The second occasion was the 
  following day. A police officer, WPC Atkinson, had come to investigate the 
  incident involving Ms Bowering. The dog was again tethered to a stake in the 
  front garden. While WPC Atkinson was talking to Mrs Bogdal at the door of 
  Wawne House she saw that the dog was becoming excited by the presence of some 
  children who were shouting at it. She went over to intervene. She remained on 
  the driveway but the dog ran over to her and bit her on the buttock. She left 
  and came back armed with a baton. As she did so, she saw Mr Bogdal gathering 
  up the rope. He told her that the dog was now in its kennel. He said that he 
  had seen the incident from the house and that he did not believe that she had 
  been bitten. He told her that it was private land and that she should not have 
  approached the dog. The third occasion was on 27th August. The 
  victim was a Ms Alexander. She was a district nurse who had gone in to 
  Sycamore House to get directions for another care home which she was trying to 
  find. As she walked back up the driveway to her car the dog jumped on her and 
  bit her leg. 

Arising out of those incidents Mr Bogdal was charged 
  with three offences under sec. 3 (1) of the 1991 Act, which is in the 
  following terms: 

"(1) If a dog is dangerously out of control in a public place 
  
(a) the owner; and


(b) if different, the person for the time being in charge of 
        the dog,
is guilty of an offence, or, if the dog while so out of control 
    injures any person, an aggravated offence, under this 
  sub-section."
Mr Bogdal was charged on the basis that he was the owner of the dog. Since 
  the aggravated offence was charged, the offences were triable on indictment. 
  He was also charged by way of alternative with three offences under sec. 3 (3) 
  of the Act; but since these were not in the event proceeded with we need not 
  deal further with that aspect. 
When the matter came before the magistrates Mr 
  Bogdal applied for the prosecution to be stayed, on grounds to which we will 
  return in due course. The application was refused, and the case was committed 
  to the Crown Court at Hull. Mr Bogdal apparently (although we do not have the 
  details of this) applied for judicial review of the refusal by the magistrates 
  to grant a stay, but permission was refused on the basis that he could renew 
  the application in the Crown Court. 

The case came on for trial on 15th 
  January 2007. Mr Bogdal was, apparently as a matter of deliberate choice, 
  unrepresented. He renewed the application for a stay which he had made before 
  the magistrates. We need not set out all the grounds on which he relied, since 
  they are mostly no longer live before us; but they included a contention that 
  the driveway on which the incidents had occurred was not a public place within 
  the meaning of sec. 3 (1). The application was heard by Miss Recorder 
  Otton-Goulder QC after the jury had been empanelled but before the case was 
  opened. She dismissed the application and made what both she and the parties 
  plainly regarded as a dispositive ruling to the effect that the driveway was a 
  public place. She also made a ruling on the admissibility of certain disputed 
  evidence. The following morning she gave, at Mr Bogdal's request, a 
 Goodyear, [2005] EWCA Crim 888, indication. 

In the light of the rulings and the Goodyear, [2005] EWCA Crim 888,  
  indication Mr Bogdal decided to plead guilty, on the express basis that he 
  reserved the right to seek to appeal on the basis that the rulings were wrong. 
  He duly pleaded guilty to the three offences under sec. 3 (1). The jury was 
  directed to enter verdicts of not guilty on the alternative counts. 

The Recorder proceeded to sentence Mr Bogdal to six 
  months imprisonment, suspended for one year, on each of the three counts, to 
  run concurrently. The sentence was subject to what the Recorder described as a 
  "condition", although strictly speaking we understand it to have been a 
  "requirement" imposed under sec. 190 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, to the 
  effect that he should not "permit any dog owned either by you or by your 
  mother to reside at Wawne House or to enter onto any of the land owned by you 
  at or within two hundred yards of Wawne House including the green sward on 
  which the dog was tethered at the time of the offences". She ordered Mr Bogdal 
  to pay costs of £1,500 and made an order under sec. 4 of the 1991 Act 
  disqualifying him from keeping a dog for a period of one year. 

We should say that both the Recorder's rulings on 
  the various issues which she dealt with on 15th October and her 
  sentencing remarks of the following day were set out with conspicuous clarity, 
  paying full regard to the position of Mr Bogdal as an unrepresented party. 


Mr Bogdal sought leave to appeal against both 
  conviction (on the basis that the disputed rulings were wrong) and sentence. 
  So far as sentence is concerned, he was given leave to appeal by the single 
  judge. As regards conviction, he was given leave by the Full Court on 
  19th June 2007, limited to the single question whether the driveway 
  was a public place. 

As we have set out, the terms of the "condition" 
  of the suspended sentence order required Mr Bogdal not to permit any dog owned 
  by himself "or his mother" to be kept at Wawne House. Mrs Bogdal commenced 
  proceedings for judicial review of that order as it affected her, contending 
  that the Recorder had no power to make an order having the effect that it did 
  on someone who was not a party to the proceedings. Permission was given by 
  Wilkie J on the papers on 4th April 2007. At the leave hearing 
  before this Court on 29th June the Court constituted itself as a 
  Divisional Court for the purpose of giving Mrs Bogdal interim relief by 
  deleting from the Recorder's order any reference to a dog owned by Mrs Bogdal. 
  The Court observed that in practice the outcome of the application for 
  judicial review was likely to depend on the outcome of Mr Bogdal's appeals. 
  

There are now before us both Mr Bogdal's appeals 
  against conviction and sentence and Mrs Bogdal's application for judicial 
  review. Mr Bogdal appears in person on his appeals. Mrs Bogdal is represented 
  by Ms Plimmer of counsel. Mr Worsley of counsel appears for the Crown in both 
  matters. Mr Bogdal and both counsel have submitted helpful skeleton arguments, 
  for which we are grateful. 

THE CRIMINAL APPEALS
We start with the appeal against conviction. In 
  loose terms, the issue which we have to determine is whether the driveway 
  where the incidents occurred was a public place within the meaning of sec. 3 
  (1). However, that formulation conceals a potential difficulty. In principle 
  that question would be for the jury to determine in the light of the evidence; 
  and it could be said that the only question for the Recorder, and for this 
  Court on appeal, was not whether the driveway was a public place but whether a 
  reasonable jury could have found that it was. From a purist's point of view 
  the correct vehicle for Mr Bogdal's application might have been a submission 
  of no case to answer at the conclusion of the Crown's case. However, there was 
  no real dispute as to the relevant primary facts, which were set out in the 
  prosecution statements (supplemented by information from Mr Bogdal which the 
  Crown did not seek to challenge). In the circumstances of the present case  
  it might not be so in all cases  those facts left no room for questions of 
  judgment or assessment which were properly within the province of the jury; 
  and the question whether, on those facts, the driveway was a public place is 
  to be characterised as a question of law. That being so, we can see no 
  objection, and indeed some advantage, to the parties seeking a preliminary 
  ruling on that question; and that is in practice what the Recorder gave, 
  albeit in the context of refusing the application for a stay. 

"Public place" is defined in sec. 10 (2) of the 
  1991 Act as follows: 

"In this Act

'public place' means any street, road or other place (whether or 
    not enclosed) to which the public have or are permitted to have access 
    whether for payment or otherwise and includes the common parts of a building 
    containing two or more separate dwellings."
We will refer to the final element of that definition, from the words "and 
  includes", as "the common parts provision". The common parts provision is, so 
  far as we are aware, unique to the 1991 Act, but the core of the definition is 
  in a form employed (with insignificant variations) in a variety of statutes, 
  dating back many years, which regulate conduct in a public place; and the 
  definition has attracted a fair amount of judicial consideration. Not all the 
  case-law was cited to us, but that no doubt showed a wise restraint on the 
  part of counsel. We are satisfied that the cases to which we were referred 
  were sufficient to allow the principles which were relevant for the resolution 
  of the present case to be identified. 
The application of sec. 10 (2) in circumstances 
  similar to those of the present case has been considered in two previous cases 
  - Fellowes v Director of Public Prosecutions, a decision of the 
  Divisional Court (Kennedy LJ and Clarke J) dated 28th January 1993 
  (briefly reported in The Times for 1.2.93, but of which we have the full 
  transcript); and R v C [2007] EWCA Crim 1757, a decision of this Court. 
  

Fellowes
In Fellowes the complainant was a schoolboy 
  delivering a newspaper to a maisonette. He was attacked by the defendant's dog 
  while he was on the path which led through from the defendant's front gate to 
  his front door. The path only served that particular dwelling and ran through 
  an area of which the defendant had the exclusive use. It was argued for the 
  Crown that the path was a "public place" because members of the public who had 
  lawful business with the occupier had an implied invitation to use it in order 
  to reach the front door. The Court rejected that submission. It relied on two 
  earlier decisions in cases concerned with the definition of "public place" in 
  other statutes. 

The first was R v Edwards and Roberts 
  (1978) 67 Cr. App. R. 228. In that case the defendants had engaged in 
  abuse of a householder while standing on his front garden path. They were 
  charged with an offence under sec. 5 of the Public Order Act 1936. The 
  question was whether the conduct charged had occurred in a public place within 
  the meaning of the section. Sec. 9 (1) of the 1936 Act provided that: 

"'Public place' includes any highway and any other premises or 
    place to which at the material time the public have or are permitted to have 
    access, whether on payment or otherwise."

This is therefore one of the many statutes referred to above applying the 
  same core definition as sec. 10 (2) of the 1991 Act. (The only differences are 
  that the governing verb is "includes" rather than "means" and that the 1991 
  Act definition adds the phrase "(whether or not enclosed)"  neither of which 
  seem to us material for present purposes.) We should however note that the 
  1936 Act contained a definition of the term "private premises" which does not 
  appear in the 1991 Act. At p. 231 in Edwards Bridge LJ said: 

"Approaching the matter quite independently of any authority, 
    and looking simply at the contrasting definitions of public place and 
    private premises in the statute, it seems to this Court that it is quite 
    impossible to hold that the expression "public place" can be construed as 
    extending to the front gardens of private premises simply on the footing on 
    which the learned judge relied that members of the public have an implied 
    licence to pass through those private gardens in order to obtain access to 
    the front doors of private premises if they have some lawful occasion for so 
    doing. It is not qua members of the public that they thus enjoy 
    access, it is qua lawful visitors. Indeed it is certainly only by 
    permission of the owner, occupier or lessee of the premises that persons 
    obtaining access to front doors in the manner referred to are entitled to 
    access. That would bring the front garden such as this within the definition 
    of private premises in the statute as opposed to bringing it within the 
    definition of a public place."
He then went on to show that that conclusion was supported by the decided 
  cases.
Clarke J, delivering the leading judgment in 
  Fellowes, observed that if the same approach as in Edwards fell 
  to be applied under the 1991 Act the path would not be a public place because 
  any member of the public using it would do so not qua member of the 
  public but qua lawful visitor. But he accepted that it might be 
  arguable that Edwards should be distinguished on the basis that Bridge 
  LJ had taken into account the definition of "private premises" in the 1936 
  Act, which had no counterpart in the 1991 Act. 

Clarke J then turned to consider Williams v 
  Director of Public Prosecutions [1992] Crim. L.R. 503. (There is in fact a 
  fuller report at (1992) 95 Cr. App. R. 415, from which we have taken the 
  passage quoted below; but the differences from the report cited by Clarke J. 
  are insignificant.). The defendant in that case was drunk and caused a 
  disturbance on the landing of the tenth floor of a block of flats. Access to 
  the block was only possible for persons who had a key or security code or who 
  were admitted by the caretaker or one of the tenants using an intercom system. 
  The defendant was charged with being drunk and disorderly in a public place 
  contrary to sec. 91 of the Criminal Justice Act 1967. Sec. 91 (4) defined 
  "public place" in identical terms to the definition in the 1936 Act; but there 
  was no reference to "private premises", so the parallel with the position 
  under the 1991 Act was closer. The Divisional Court (Nolan LJ and Jowitt J) 
  held that the landing was not a public place. Jowitt J, delivering the main 
  judgment, said: 

"In the present case, the issue is whether those who gained 
    access or were permitted to have access to this block of flats went there as 
    members of the public or in some private capacity.
The appropriate starting point to the resolution of the issue in 
    this case is to ask who had or who was permitted to have access to this 
    block of flats and why, and to ask whether the methods by which access was 
    to be gained shed light on the answer to that question. Approached in this 
    way, the question was the landing in this case a public place, admits of 
    only one answer. It was not. People are not permitted to enter this building 
    and be on the landings as they please. The manifest purpose of the control 
    exercised over entry from the outer door (or it may be doors) from the 
    street is to prevent entry, save by those who visit the building for social, 
    business or professional dealings with those who live in the flats (for 
    example, the friend, the milkman or the doctor) or for purposes connected 
    with the building itself, such as maintenance. This connection with the 
    occupiers or the building takes visitors out of the general public and gives 
    a private (as opposed to public) nature to their access."
Jowitt J noted that the justices had attached weight to the fact that a 
  variety of members of the public other than the occupiers of the flat  such 
  as postmen and tradesmen - would be entitled to access, but he said that that 
  was not the point: 

"To speak of tradesmen and postmen as being members of the 
    public when they are on these premises, begs the question of whether such 
    visitors are members of the public once they have entered the block of 
    flats. We are all members of the public. It does not follow that all our 
    actions and all our visits are performed as members of the public. It seems 
    to me that here the justices were confusing numbers of visitors with 
    purpose."

Jowitt J distinguished the earlier decision in Knox v Anderton 
  (1983) 77 Cr. App. R. 156, in which the Divisional Court had held that 
  justices had been entitled to find that the upper walkway of a block of flats, 
  forming part of a large estate, was a public place for the purpose of the 
  Prevention of Crime Act 1953. The evidence in Knox v Anderton had been 
  that members of the public had free access to the walkways, which were  to 
  use Mr Worsley's useful phrase - "pavements in the sky", and were not 
  approached through any gates or doors, irrespective of whether they had 
  business with the particular flats that they served. It can be seen that 
  Williams adopted an essentially similar approach to Edwards, 
  making it clear that the crucial question was the capacity in which any 
  members of the public had access to the place in question. 
Having reviewed those authorities, Clarke J 
  observed that, as we have already noted, the language of the definitions in 
  the 1936 and 1967 Acts was substantially the same as that of sec. 10 (2) save 
  as regards the common parts provision. That provision was not of course 
  directly relevant on the facts of the case before the Court, and he said 
  nothing about it save to observe that it had presumably been added to the 
  definition in response to Knox v Anderton. (As to that, we permitted Mr 
  Worsley to show us, de bene esse, the relevant passage in Hansard. This 
  reveals, as might in any case have been inferred, that the common parts 
  provision was introduced, by amendment of the original bill, in order to 
  ensure that the Act applied to the presence of dangerous dogs in the common 
  parts of blocks of flats. It was feared that such parts would not otherwise be 
  a "public place" within the meaning of the definition.) Clarke J then said: 
  

"In my judgment, in the light of the meaning which has been 
    given to "public place" in the Public Order Act 1936, and particularly in 
    the Criminal Justice Act 1967, the path leading to the appellant's front 
    door was not a public place within the meaning of section 10 (2) of the 
    Dangerous Dogs Act 1991. [The complainant] visited it qua visitor and not 
    qua member of the public. I do not think that it is possible to reach any 
    different conclusion by a consideration of the purposes of the Dangerous 
    Dogs Act 1991."
The ratio in Fellowes thus is that a 
  place which is of its nature private, such as a front garden or the common 
  parts of a block of flats, will only be a "public place" if members of the 
  public have access to it otherwise than at the invitation (express or implied) 
  of the occupier. In reaching that conclusion the Court was applying the 
  reasoning of this Court in Edwards and the Divisional Court in 
  Williams. 

R v C 
In R v C (which was decided subsequently to 
  Mr Bogdal's conviction) the complainant had been attacked by two dogs in a 
  fenced area, used for depositing rubbish, which lay off a pathway leading from 
  a block of flats to the car park serving the flats. The area formed part of 
  the common parts of the block of flats, in the sense that it was part of the 
  communal area, but it did not form part of any building. Only occupiers of the 
  flats or their licensees would be entitled to enter it. 

On a prosecution under sec. 3 (1) the Judge in the 
  Crown Court ruled that the area was not a public place within the meaning of 
  the Act. He held that it was not caught by the terms of the common parts 
  provision because it was not part of a building; and that it followed that : 
  

" the external parts are by the words of that Section 
    specifically excluded and not, as [counsel for the Crown] contends, by 
    implication included."
The Crown applied to this Court for leave to 
  appeal against that ruling under sec. 58 of the 2003 Act. The application was 
  dismissed. Royce J, giving the judgment of the Court, expressly approved the 
  Judge's reasoning and observed that since this was a penal statute it had to 
  be strictly construed. He said that that conclusion appeared to be consistent 
  with Fellowes, of which he set out the key passage, although it was 
  unnecessary for him to embark on any detailed analysis. 

Royce J also referred to the decision of the 
  Divisional Court in Harriott v Director of Public Prosecutions [2005] 
  EWCA 965 (Admin). That case concerned the offence of carrying a bladed article 
  in a public place contrary to sec. 139 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988. In it 
  Sedley LJ said this: 

"10. While it would not be useful or wise for this court to 
    attempt to substitute for the statutory phrase some definition or exegesis 
    of its own, it seems to me that the principle which runs through all of 
    these cases is that land may be either on the face of it public or on the 
    face of it private land: a street would be an example of the former, the 
    front garden or front area of a private dwelling an example of the latter. 
    In the latter case, however, it is also clear that the ostensibly private 
    character of the land may be negated by evidence that the general public - 
    that is to say anyone who wants to - does in fact have access to it, whether 
    by permission or not. This was the case in Knox v Anderton. It was 
    not the case in the 1978 case of Roberts which concerned, as this 
    case does, the enclosed but accessible area between a house and the 
  highway.
11. Does the nature of the offence make a difference, as 
    [counsel for the Crown] was inclined to argue it did? In other words, may a 
    public place have a different meaning depending on whether the charge is 
    driving a motor vehicle there, being drunk and disorderly there, or carrying 
    a bladed article there? The decision in the 2003 case of R v Roberts 
    suggests not. It would, moreover, be disruptive of legal certainty if a 
    phrase repeatedly used by Parliament, albeit for different purposes, were 
    given differential meanings in this way."
("The 1978 case of Roberts" must, we think, be a reference to 
  Edwards, in which the second defendant was a Mr. Roberts. The "2003 
  case" is R v Roberts [2004] 1 WLR 181, a case in this Court, also on 
  sec. 139 of the 1988 Act, in which Edwards was followed.)
R v C is not on its facts a case where, as 
  in Fellowes, members of the general public had access to the place in 
  question. But the restrictive approach to the construction of sec. 10 (2), and 
  the observations from Harriott which Royce J adopted, are highly 
  material. It is also, as appears below, directly relevant to one aspect of the 
  Recorder's reasoning. 

The Recorder's reasoning
The Recorder was referred to Fellowes, 
  though only in the very abbreviated report in The Times. She 
  believed that it should be distinguished on the basis that in the present case 
  the driveway which is the relevant "place" constituted the access not only to 
  Wawne House but also to Sycamore House, and could be used by lawful visitors 
  to either property, whereas the path in Fellowes (and indeed in 
  Edwards) only served one dwelling. She said: 

"If the ratio of the garden path case - that is, the 
    Fellowes case - is that it is a matter of invitation, whether 
    explicit or implied, that cannot arise when one is dealing with a shared 
    drive, because while a person may be implicitly or explicitly invited by let 
    us say the owners of Wawne House, so far as Sycamore House is concerned 
    there is no invitation whatsoever, whether explicit or implicit, and the 
    same of course applies vice versa."
She further said that the terms of the common parts provision showed, "by 
  analogy", that common access routes of this kind fell within the terms of sec. 
  10 (2).
With respect to the Recorder, we cannot accept 
  that reasoning. 

Taking first the fact that use of the driveway was 
  shared as between Wawne House and Sycamore House, we do not believe that that 
  is a relevant distinction having regard to the ratio of Fellowes 
  as we have identified it. The driveway was plainly, to use Sedley LJ's 
  phrase in Harriott, "on the face of it private"; and members of the 
  public were only entitled to use it as visitors to Wawne House or Sycamore 
  House. We cannot see that it can make any difference in principle that there 
  are two properties served by the driveway: the right of members of the public 
  to use it remains qua visitor, whichever property they happened to be 
  visiting. The position is no different from that in Williams. In that 
  case there were a large number of flats in the block, and members of the 
  public will have used the lifts and landings in order to visit any one of a 
  number of different properties, but the Divisional Court made the point 
  expressly that that did not alter the private capacity in which they did so 
  (see the second passage quoted in para. 19 above). 

As for the common parts provision, the Recorder 
  accepted that it had no direct application, no doubt because even if the 
  driveway could have been described as constituting "common parts" as between 
  the two properties, it was not part of a building (as subsequently confirmed 
  in R v C). Her "analogy" point was, as we understand it, that 
  since the internal common parts of a building were a public place within the 
  meaning of the Act it would be odd if a path or drive of which visitors to 
  more than one dwelling had the use were not also a public place. We see the 
  sense of that, but we do not think that it can be reconciled with the way that 
  the section is drafted. Parliament has, in the inclusionary words of the 
  common parts provision, specified in express terms the extent to which common 
  parts would fall within the terms of the definition  namely if they are parts 
  "of a building". It cannot be legitimate then to rely on that very provision 
  as requiring the main core of the definition to be extended to cover external 
  common parts or other "analogous" land. That seems indeed to be the same 
  argument which was rejected in R v C. 

Decision
We therefore do not think that the decision in 
  Fellowes can be distinguished as the Recorder sought to do. Since it is 
  a decision of the Divisional Court, we are not as such bound by 
  Fellowes, but its reasoning is based on Edwards, which is a 
  decision of this Court; and although Edwards was concerned with a 
  different statute we see much force in the point made by Sedley LJ in 
  Harriott that it is undesirable that substantially identical words 
  should be given different meanings in different statutes. The only material 
  difference between the language considered in Edwards and that of sec. 
  10 (2) is the common parts provision; and, for the reasons given above, that 
  is of no relevance save in those cases to which it directly applies. In our 
  view Fellowes was rightly decided and its reasoning applies equally to 
  the facts of the present case. 

The distinction which we thus accept between 
  access qua member of the public and access qua visitor may at 
  first sight seem a gloss on the terms of the statute. But, as we have shown, 
  it is well-established by authority: there are indeed several other cases to a 
  similar effect not cited to us (of which perhaps the most helpful is 
  Director of Public Prosecutions v. Vivier [1991] R.T.R. 205). And on 
  closer consideration such a distinction can be seen to be essential if the 
  concept of a "public place" is not to lose touch with ordinary usage and with 
  important liberties. If every householder's front garden was a "public place" 
  by reason only of the fact that the postman or the Jehovah's witness has an 
  implied invitation to make their way to the front door, the result would be 
  that not only could he not keep his dangerous dog outside but that he could 
  neither carry a knife within his own curtilage nor enjoy the pleasure of being 
  drunk and disorderly on his own front lawn. 

We should mention two submissions advanced by Mr 
  Worsley, though they formed no part of the reasoning of the Recorder. 

His first submission was that the only question 
  under the definition is whether there was any physical barrier to members of 
  the public accessing the "place" in question: if not, then members of the 
  public will "have access" even if they may not be "permitted to have access". 
  That cannot be right. Whatever the precise effect of the formula "have or are 
  permitted to have", it certainly does not mean that any place that a member of 
  the public can physically access, however obviously private it may be, is a 
  public place: otherwise every front drive that was not barred by a gate would 
  be a public place. 

His second submission was that the fact that 
  Sycamore House was a care home meant, or in any event might mean, that the 
  driveway giving access to it was  again using Sedley LJ's phrase  "on the 
  face of it public". We do not accept this. There are of course many kinds of 
  commercial or institutional premises to which members of the public, or a 
  class of members of the public, have access as such  examples from the 
  decided cases include football grounds, public car-parks, shops, and places of 
  entertainment  but not every institution is of that character. The borderline 
  between public and private places may not always be easy to define, and there 
  will be some doubtful cases. But we cannot see that it is arguable that the 
  public as such has access to a private care home  or, still less, to a 
  driveway leading to such a home through a private garden. 

We must accordingly allow this appeal and quash Mr 
  Bogdal's conviction on all three counts. We appreciate that the effect of our 
  doing so is that in cases of the present kind, where occupiers of neighbouring 
  private properties and their visitors have the use of shared access paths or 
  roads, users of such common access will not have the protection of the 
  provisions of the 1991 Act (though they may of course have other protections 
  including under the Dogs Act 1871). But Parliament chose, for reasons that we 
  can understand, to limit the effects of the Act to cases where dogs are let 
  out of control in a "public place" (using a well-tried statutory definition) 
  even though, as the facts of the present case and of Fellowes show, 
  dangerous dogs may also be a menace in private places. It may be anomalous 
  that one particular kind of private space  namely the common parts of a 
  building shared by more than one dwelling  should have been specially brought 
  within the statutory definition when others are not; but this is a notoriously 
  ill-conceived statute, and it is not for us to seek to re-draft it. 

However, we wish in conclusion strongly to 
  encourage Mr and Mrs Bogdal to take steps (if they have not already done so) 
  to ensure that there is no repetition of the incidents which gave rise to the 
  prosecution and that the dog in question does not pose a risk to legitimate 
  users of the driveway serving Wawne House and Sycamore House. The fact that 
  that driveway is not a public place does not mean that they may not incur 
  civil liabilities arising out of its behaviour or get into trouble with the 
  law in other ways than under the 1991 Act. 

With the quashing of the conviction the appeal 
  against sentence becomes redundant. 

THE JUDICIAL REVIEW APPLICATION
Since Mrs Bogdal's challenge was to the terms of 
  the requirement imposed on Mr Bogdal under sec. 190 of the 2003 Act the 
  quashing of his conviction also removes the need for any relief; and, sitting 
  as a Divisional Court, we accordingly make no substantive order on her 
  application. If Mrs Bogdal seeks any consequential order, she should lodge 
  written representations with the Administrative Court within 14 days of the 
  hand-down date of this judgment.

[
MR JUSTICE UNDERHILL: 
There are before us two matters arising out of the 
  same background  an appeal by Mr Michael Bogdal against his conviction and 
  sentence in the Hull Crown Court for three offences under the Dangerous Dogs 
  Act 1991, and an application for judicial review of the same order of the 
  Crown Court brought by his mother, Mrs Janina Bogdal. We are dealing with the 
  former as the Court of Appeal (Criminal Division) and the latter as a 
  Divisional Court. The primary issue which we have to decide is whether the 
  location at which the offences of which Mr Bogdal was convicted was a "public 
  place" within the meaning of the Act. 

FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY
Mr Bogdal, who is aged 59, was at all material times 
  the owner of a property called Wawne House in Hull. The only person living 
  there at the material time was Mrs Bogdal, who is aged 87. Mr Bogdal does not 
  live there himself but he is there a good deal. Wawne House lies a little way 
  back from the main road with an extensive area of lawn as its front garden. In 
  what used to be its back garden is a property called Sycamore House, which is 
  a private care home for the elderly: it was built by Mr. Bogdal some years ago 
  but subsequently sold by him. A broad tarmac driveway runs in a horseshoe 
  shape to and from the road round the edge of the front garden of Wawne House 
  and around the back to Sycamore House: one limb of the horseshoe is bordered 
  by shrubs but the other is unscreened from the lawn. The driveway constitutes 
  the main means of access to both buildings and may be used by any person with 
  legitimate occasion to visit either Wawne House or Sycamore House. It is not a 
  public right of way. There are no gates where the driveway meets the road, but 
  there is a large sign for Sycamore House at the principal opening. 

On three occasions in the summer of 2005 visitors 
  walking on the shared driveway were attacked and bitten by an Alsatian dog. 
  The first occasion was on 29th May. The victim was a Ms Bowering, 
  who was going to visit her mother, a resident in Sycamore House. She was on a 
  bicycle. The dog was tethered to a rope which was attached to a stake driven 
  into the lawn in front of Wawne House; but the rope was not short enough to 
  prevent it from attacking her on the driveway. The second occasion was the 
  following day. A police officer, WPC Atkinson, had come to investigate the 
  incident involving Ms Bowering. The dog was again tethered to a stake in the 
  front garden. While WPC Atkinson was talking to Mrs Bogdal at the door of 
  Wawne House she saw that the dog was becoming excited by the presence of some 
  children who were shouting at it. She went over to intervene. She remained on 
  the driveway but the dog ran over to her and bit her on the buttock. She left 
  and came back armed with a baton. As she did so, she saw Mr Bogdal gathering 
  up the rope. He told her that the dog was now in its kennel. He said that he 
  had seen the incident from the house and that he did not believe that she had 
  been bitten. He told her that it was private land and that she should not have 
  approached the dog. The third occasion was on 27th August. The 
  victim was a Ms Alexander. She was a district nurse who had gone in to 
  Sycamore House to get directions for another care home which she was trying to 
  find. As she walked back up the driveway to her car the dog jumped on her and 
  bit her leg. 

Arising out of those incidents Mr Bogdal was charged 
  with three offences under sec. 3 (1) of the 1991 Act, which is in the 
  following terms: 

"(1) If a dog is dangerously out of control in a public place 
  
(a) the owner; and


(b) if different, the person for the time being in charge of 
        the dog,
is guilty of an offence, or, if the dog while so out of control 
    injures any person, an aggravated offence, under this 
  sub-section."
Mr Bogdal was charged on the basis that he was the owner of the dog. Since 
  the aggravated offence was charged, the offences were triable on indictment. 
  He was also charged by way of alternative with three offences under sec. 3 (3) 
  of the Act; but since these were not in the event proceeded with we need not 
  deal further with that aspect. 
When the matter came before the magistrates Mr 
  Bogdal applied for the prosecution to be stayed, on grounds to which we will 
  return in due course. The application was refused, and the case was committed 
  to the Crown Court at Hull. Mr Bogdal apparently (although we do not have the 
  details of this) applied for judicial review of the refusal by the magistrates 
  to grant a stay, but permission was refused on the basis that he could renew 
  the application in the Crown Court. 

The case came on for trial on 15th 
  January 2007. Mr Bogdal was, apparently as a matter of deliberate choice, 
  unrepresented. He renewed the application for a stay which he had made before 
  the magistrates. We need not set out all the grounds on which he relied, since 
  they are mostly no longer live before us; but they included a contention that 
  the driveway on which the incidents had occurred was not a public place within 
  the meaning of sec. 3 (1). The application was heard by Miss Recorder 
  Otton-Goulder QC after the jury had been empanelled but before the case was 
  opened. She dismissed the application and made what both she and the parties 
  plainly regarded as a dispositive ruling to the effect that the driveway was a 
  public place. She also made a ruling on the admissibility of certain disputed 
  evidence. The following morning she gave, at Mr Bogdal's request, a 
 Goodyear, [2005] EWCA Crim 888, indication. 

In the light of the rulings and the Goodyear, [2005] EWCA Crim 888,  
  indication Mr Bogdal decided to plead guilty, on the express basis that he 
  reserved the right to seek to appeal on the basis that the rulings were wrong. 
  He duly pleaded guilty to the three offences under sec. 3 (1). The jury was 
  directed to enter verdicts of not guilty on the alternative counts. 

The Recorder proceeded to sentence Mr Bogdal to six 
  months imprisonment, suspended for one year, on each of the three counts, to 
  run concurrently. The sentence was subject to what the Recorder described as a 
  "condition", although strictly speaking we understand it to have been a 
  "requirement" imposed under sec. 190 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, to the 
  effect that he should not "permit any dog owned either by you or by your 
  mother to reside at Wawne House or to enter onto any of the land owned by you 
  at or within two hundred yards of Wawne House including the green sward on 
  which the dog was tethered at the time of the offences". She ordered Mr Bogdal 
  to pay costs of £1,500 and made an order under sec. 4 of the 1991 Act 
  disqualifying him from keeping a dog for a period of one year. 

We should say that both the Recorder's rulings on 
  the various issues which she dealt with on 15th October and her 
  sentencing remarks of the following day were set out with conspicuous clarity, 
  paying full regard to the position of Mr Bogdal as an unrepresented party. 


Mr Bogdal sought leave to appeal against both 
  conviction (on the basis that the disputed rulings were wrong) and sentence. 
  So far as sentence is concerned, he was given leave to appeal by the single 
  judge. As regards conviction, he was given leave by the Full Court on 
  19th June 2007, limited to the single question whether the driveway 
  was a public place. 

As we have set out, the terms of the "condition" 
  of the suspended sentence order required Mr Bogdal not to permit any dog owned 
  by himself "or his mother" to be kept at Wawne House. Mrs Bogdal commenced 
  proceedings for judicial review of that order as it affected her, contending 
  that the Recorder had no power to make an order having the effect that it did 
  on someone who was not a party to the proceedings. Permission was given by 
  Wilkie J on the papers on 4th April 2007. At the leave hearing 
  before this Court on 29th June the Court constituted itself as a 
  Divisional Court for the purpose of giving Mrs Bogdal interim relief by 
  deleting from the Recorder's order any reference to a dog owned by Mrs Bogdal. 
  The Court observed that in practice the outcome of the application for 
  judicial review was likely to depend on the outcome of Mr Bogdal's appeals. 
  

There are now before us both Mr Bogdal's appeals 
  against conviction and sentence and Mrs Bogdal's application for judicial 
  review. Mr Bogdal appears in person on his appeals. Mrs Bogdal is represented 
  by Ms Plimmer of counsel. Mr Worsley of counsel appears for the Crown in both 
  matters. Mr Bogdal and both counsel have submitted helpful skeleton arguments, 
  for which we are grateful. 

THE CRIMINAL APPEALS
We start with the appeal against conviction. In 
  loose terms, the issue which we have to determine is whether the driveway 
  where the incidents occurred was a public place within the meaning of sec. 3 
  (1). However, that formulation conceals a potential difficulty. In principle 
  that question would be for the jury to determine in the light of the evidence; 
  and it could be said that the only question for the Recorder, and for this 
  Court on appeal, was not whether the driveway was a public place but whether a 
  reasonable jury could have found that it was. From a purist's point of view 
  the correct vehicle for Mr Bogdal's application might have been a submission 
  of no case to answer at the conclusion of the Crown's case. However, there was 
  no real dispute as to the relevant primary facts, which were set out in the 
  prosecution statements (supplemented by information from Mr Bogdal which the 
  Crown did not seek to challenge). In the circumstances of the present case  
  it might not be so in all cases  those facts left no room for questions of 
  judgment or assessment which were properly within the province of the jury; 
  and the question whether, on those facts, the driveway was a public place is 
  to be characterised as a question of law. That being so, we can see no 
  objection, and indeed some advantage, to the parties seeking a preliminary 
  ruling on that question; and that is in practice what the Recorder gave, 
  albeit in the context of refusing the application for a stay. 

"Public place" is defined in sec. 10 (2) of the 
  1991 Act as follows: 

"In this Act

'public place' means any street, road or other place (whether or 
    not enclosed) to which the public have or are permitted to have access 
    whether for payment or otherwise and includes the common parts of a building 
    containing two or more separate dwellings."
We will refer to the final element of that definition, from the words "and 
  includes", as "the common parts provision". The common parts provision is, so 
  far as we are aware, unique to the 1991 Act, but the core of the definition is 
  in a form employed (with insignificant variations) in a variety of statutes, 
  dating back many years, which regulate conduct in a public place; and the 
  definition has attracted a fair amount of judicial consideration. Not all the 
  case-law was cited to us, but that no doubt showed a wise restraint on the 
  part of counsel. We are satisfied that the cases to which we were referred 
  were sufficient to allow the principles which were relevant for the resolution 
  of the present case to be identified. 
The application of sec. 10 (2) in circumstances 
  similar to those of the present case has been considered in two previous cases 
  - Fellowes v Director of Public Prosecutions, a decision of the 
  Divisional Court (Kennedy LJ and Clarke J) dated 28th January 1993 
  (briefly reported in The Times for 1.2.93, but of which we have the full 
  transcript); and R v C [2007] EWCA Crim 1757, a decision of this Court. 
  

Fellowes
In Fellowes the complainant was a schoolboy 
  delivering a newspaper to a maisonette. He was attacked by the defendant's dog 
  while he was on the path which led through from the defendant's front gate to 
  his front door. The path only served that particular dwelling and ran through 
  an area of which the defendant had the exclusive use. It was argued for the 
  Crown that the path was a "public place" because members of the public who had 
  lawful business with the occupier had an implied invitation to use it in order 
  to reach the front door. The Court rejected that submission. It relied on two 
  earlier decisions in cases concerned with the definition of "public place" in 
  other statutes. 

The first was R v Edwards and Roberts 
  (1978) 67 Cr. App. R. 228. In that case the defendants had engaged in 
  abuse of a householder while standing on his front garden path. They were 
  charged with an offence under sec. 5 of the Public Order Act 1936. The 
  question was whether the conduct charged had occurred in a public place within 
  the meaning of the section. Sec. 9 (1) of the 1936 Act provided that: 

"'Public place' includes any highway and any other premises or 
    place to which at the material time the public have or are permitted to have 
    access, whether on payment or otherwise."

This is therefore one of the many statutes referred to above applying the 
  same core definition as sec. 10 (2) of the 1991 Act. (The only differences are 
  that the governing verb is "includes" rather than "means" and that the 1991 
  Act definition adds the phrase "(whether or not enclosed)"  neither of which 
  seem to us material for present purposes.) We should however note that the 
  1936 Act contained a definition of the term "private premises" which does not 
  appear in the 1991 Act. At p. 231 in Edwards Bridge LJ said: 

"Approaching the matter quite independently of any authority, 
    and looking simply at the contrasting definitions of public place and 
    private premises in the statute, it seems to this Court that it is quite 
    impossible to hold that the expression "public place" can be construed as 
    extending to the front gardens of private premises simply on the footing on 
    which the learned judge relied that members of the public have an implied 
    licence to pass through those private gardens in order to obtain access to 
    the front doors of private premises if they have some lawful occasion for so 
    doing. It is not qua members of the public that they thus enjoy 
    access, it is qua lawful visitors. Indeed it is certainly only by 
    permission of the owner, occupier or lessee of the premises that persons 
    obtaining access to front doors in the manner referred to are entitled to 
    access. That would bring the front garden such as this within the definition 
    of private premises in the statute as opposed to bringing it within the 
    definition of a public place."
He then went on to show that that conclusion was supported by the decided 
  cases.
Clarke J, delivering the leading judgment in 
  Fellowes, observed that if the same approach as in Edwards fell 
  to be applied under the 1991 Act the path would not be a public place because 
  any member of the public using it would do so not qua member of the 
  public but qua lawful visitor. But he accepted that it might be 
  arguable that Edwards should be distinguished on the basis that Bridge 
  LJ had taken into account the definition of "private premises" in the 1936 
  Act, which had no counterpart in the 1991 Act. 

Clarke J then turned to consider Williams v 
  Director of Public Prosecutions [1992] Crim. L.R. 503. (There is in fact a 
  fuller report at (1992) 95 Cr. App. R. 415, from which we have taken the 
  passage quoted below; but the differences from the report cited by Clarke J. 
  are insignificant.). The defendant in that case was drunk and caused a 
  disturbance on the landing of the tenth floor of a block of flats. Access to 
  the block was only possible for persons who had a key or security code or who 
  were admitted by the caretaker or one of the tenants using an intercom system. 
  The defendant was charged with being drunk and disorderly in a public place 
  contrary to sec. 91 of the Criminal Justice Act 1967. Sec. 91 (4) defined 
  "public place" in identical terms to the definition in the 1936 Act; but there 
  was no reference to "private premises", so the parallel with the position 
  under the 1991 Act was closer. The Divisional Court (Nolan LJ and Jowitt J) 
  held that the landing was not a public place. Jowitt J, delivering the main 
  judgment, said: 

"In the present case, the issue is whether those who gained 
    access or were permitted to have access to this block of flats went there as 
    members of the public or in some private capacity.
The appropriate starting point to the resolution of the issue in 
    this case is to ask who had or who was permitted to have access to this 
    block of flats and why, and to ask whether the methods by which access was 
    to be gained shed light on the answer to that question. Approached in this 
    way, the question was the landing in this case a public place, admits of 
    only one answer. It was not. People are not permitted to enter this building 
    and be on the landings as they please. The manifest purpose of the control 
    exercised over entry from the outer door (or it may be doors) from the 
    street is to prevent entry, save by those who visit the building for social, 
    business or professional dealings with those who live in the flats (for 
    example, the friend, the milkman or the doctor) or for purposes connected 
    with the building itself, such as maintenance. This connection with the 
    occupiers or the building takes visitors out of the general public and gives 
    a private (as opposed to public) nature to their access."
Jowitt J noted that the justices had attached weight to the fact that a 
  variety of members of the public other than the occupiers of the flat  such 
  as postmen and tradesmen - would be entitled to access, but he said that that 
  was not the point: 

"To speak of tradesmen and postmen as being members of the 
    public when they are on these premises, begs the question of whether such 
    visitors are members of the public once they have entered the block of 
    flats. We are all members of the public. It does not follow that all our 
    actions and all our visits are performed as members of the public. It seems 
    to me that here the justices were confusing numbers of visitors with 
    purpose."

Jowitt J distinguished the earlier decision in Knox v Anderton 
  (1983) 77 Cr. App. R. 156, in which the Divisional Court had held that 
  justices had been entitled to find that the upper walkway of a block of flats, 
  forming part of a large estate, was a public place for the purpose of the 
  Prevention of Crime Act 1953. The evidence in Knox v Anderton had been 
  that members of the public had free access to the walkways, which were  to 
  use Mr Worsley's useful phrase - "pavements in the sky", and were not 
  approached through any gates or doors, irrespective of whether they had 
  business with the particular flats that they served. It can be seen that 
  Williams adopted an essentially similar approach to Edwards, 
  making it clear that the crucial question was the capacity in which any 
  members of the public had access to the place in question. 
Having reviewed those authorities, Clarke J 
  observed that, as we have already noted, the language of the definitions in 
  the 1936 and 1967 Acts was substantially the same as that of sec. 10 (2) save 
  as regards the common parts provision. That provision was not of course 
  directly relevant on the facts of the case before the Court, and he said 
  nothing about it save to observe that it had presumably been added to the 
  definition in response to Knox v Anderton. (As to that, we permitted Mr 
  Worsley to show us, de bene esse, the relevant passage in Hansard. This 
  reveals, as might in any case have been inferred, that the common parts 
  provision was introduced, by amendment of the original bill, in order to 
  ensure that the Act applied to the presence of dangerous dogs in the common 
  parts of blocks of flats. It was feared that such parts would not otherwise be 
  a "public place" within the meaning of the definition.) Clarke J then said: 
  

"In my judgment, in the light of the meaning which has been 
    given to "public place" in the Public Order Act 1936, and particularly in 
    the Criminal Justice Act 1967, the path leading to the appellant's front 
    door was not a public place within the meaning of section 10 (2) of the 
    Dangerous Dogs Act 1991. [The complainant] visited it qua visitor and not 
    qua member of the public. I do not think that it is possible to reach any 
    different conclusion by a consideration of the purposes of the Dangerous 
    Dogs Act 1991."
The ratio in Fellowes thus is that a 
  place which is of its nature private, such as a front garden or the common 
  parts of a block of flats, will only be a "public place" if members of the 
  public have access to it otherwise than at the invitation (express or implied) 
  of the occupier. In reaching that conclusion the Court was applying the 
  reasoning of this Court in Edwards and the Divisional Court in 
  Williams. 

R v C 
In R v C (which was decided subsequently to 
  Mr Bogdal's conviction) the complainant had been attacked by two dogs in a 
  fenced area, used for depositing rubbish, which lay off a pathway leading from 
  a block of flats to the car park serving the flats. The area formed part of 
  the common parts of the block of flats, in the sense that it was part of the 
  communal area, but it did not form part of any building. Only occupiers of the 
  flats or their licensees would be entitled to enter it. 

On a prosecution under sec. 3 (1) the Judge in the 
  Crown Court ruled that the area was not a public place within the meaning of 
  the Act. He held that it was not caught by the terms of the common parts 
  provision because it was not part of a building; and that it followed that : 
  

" the external parts are by the words of that Section 
    specifically excluded and not, as [counsel for the Crown] contends, by 
    implication included."
The Crown applied to this Court for leave to 
  appeal against that ruling under sec. 58 of the 2003 Act. The application was 
  dismissed. Royce J, giving the judgment of the Court, expressly approved the 
  Judge's reasoning and observed that since this was a penal statute it had to 
  be strictly construed. He said that that conclusion appeared to be consistent 
  with Fellowes, of which he set out the key passage, although it was 
  unnecessary for him to embark on any detailed analysis. 

Royce J also referred to the decision of the 
  Divisional Court in Harriott v Director of Public Prosecutions [2005] 
  EWCA 965 (Admin). That case concerned the offence of carrying a bladed article 
  in a public place contrary to sec. 139 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988. In it 
  Sedley LJ said this: 

"10. While it would not be useful or wise for this court to 
    attempt to substitute for the statutory phrase some definition or exegesis 
    of its own, it seems to me that the principle which runs through all of 
    these cases is that land may be either on the face of it public or on the 
    face of it private land: a street would be an example of the former, the 
    front garden or front area of a private dwelling an example of the latter. 
    In the latter case, however, it is also clear that the ostensibly private 
    character of the land may be negated by evidence that the general public - 
    that is to say anyone who wants to - does in fact have access to it, whether 
    by permission or not. This was the case in Knox v Anderton. It was 
    not the case in the 1978 case of Roberts which concerned, as this 
    case does, the enclosed but accessible area between a house and the 
  highway.
11. Does the nature of the offence make a difference, as 
    [counsel for the Crown] was inclined to argue it did? In other words, may a 
    public place have a different meaning depending on whether the charge is 
    driving a motor vehicle there, being drunk and disorderly there, or carrying 
    a bladed article there? The decision in the 2003 case of R v Roberts 
    suggests not. It would, moreover, be disruptive of legal certainty if a 
    phrase repeatedly used by Parliament, albeit for different purposes, were 
    given differential meanings in this way."
("The 1978 case of Roberts" must, we think, be a reference to 
  Edwards, in which the second defendant was a Mr. Roberts. The "2003 
  case" is R v Roberts [2004] 1 WLR 181, a case in this Court, also on 
  sec. 139 of the 1988 Act, in which Edwards was followed.)
R v C is not on its facts a case where, as 
  in Fellowes, members of the general public had access to the place in 
  question. But the restrictive approach to the construction of sec. 10 (2), and 
  the observations from Harriott which Royce J adopted, are highly 
  material. It is also, as appears below, directly relevant to one aspect of the 
  Recorder's reasoning. 

The Recorder's reasoning
The Recorder was referred to Fellowes, 
  though only in the very abbreviated report in The Times. She 
  believed that it should be distinguished on the basis that in the present case 
  the driveway which is the relevant "place" constituted the access not only to 
  Wawne House but also to Sycamore House, and could be used by lawful visitors 
  to either property, whereas the path in Fellowes (and indeed in 
  Edwards) only served one dwelling. She said: 

"If the ratio of the garden path case - that is, the 
    Fellowes case - is that it is a matter of invitation, whether 
    explicit or implied, that cannot arise when one is dealing with a shared 
    drive, because while a person may be implicitly or explicitly invited by let 
    us say the owners of Wawne House, so far as Sycamore House is concerned 
    there is no invitation whatsoever, whether explicit or implicit, and the 
    same of course applies vice versa."
She further said that the terms of the common parts provision showed, "by 
  analogy", that common access routes of this kind fell within the terms of sec. 
  10 (2).
With respect to the Recorder, we cannot accept 
  that reasoning. 

Taking first the fact that use of the driveway was 
  shared as between Wawne House and Sycamore House, we do not believe that that 
  is a relevant distinction having regard to the ratio of Fellowes 
  as we have identified it. The driveway was plainly, to use Sedley LJ's 
  phrase in Harriott, "on the face of it private"; and members of the 
  public were only entitled to use it as visitors to Wawne House or Sycamore 
  House. We cannot see that it can make any difference in principle that there 
  are two properties served by the driveway: the right of members of the public 
  to use it remains qua visitor, whichever property they happened to be 
  visiting. The position is no different from that in Williams. In that 
  case there were a large number of flats in the block, and members of the 
  public will have used the lifts and landings in order to visit any one of a 
  number of different properties, but the Divisional Court made the point 
  expressly that that did not alter the private capacity in which they did so 
  (see the second passage quoted in para. 19 above). 

As for the common parts provision, the Recorder 
  accepted that it had no direct application, no doubt because even if the 
  driveway could have been described as constituting "common parts" as between 
  the two properties, it was not part of a building (as subsequently confirmed 
  in R v C). Her "analogy" point was, as we understand it, that 
  since the internal common parts of a building were a public place within the 
  meaning of the Act it would be odd if a path or drive of which visitors to 
  more than one dwelling had the use were not also a public place. We see the 
  sense of that, but we do not think that it can be reconciled with the way that 
  the section is drafted. Parliament has, in the inclusionary words of the 
  common parts provision, specified in express terms the extent to which common 
  parts would fall within the terms of the definition  namely if they are parts 
  "of a building". It cannot be legitimate then to rely on that very provision 
  as requiring the main core of the definition to be extended to cover external 
  common parts or other "analogous" land. That seems indeed to be the same 
  argument which was rejected in R v C. 

Decision
We therefore do not think that the decision in 
  Fellowes can be distinguished as the Recorder sought to do. Since it is 
  a decision of the Divisional Court, we are not as such bound by 
  Fellowes, but its reasoning is based on Edwards, which is a 
  decision of this Court; and although Edwards was concerned with a 
  different statute we see much force in the point made by Sedley LJ in 
  Harriott that it is undesirable that substantially identical words 
  should be given different meanings in different statutes. The only material 
  difference between the language considered in Edwards and that of sec. 
  10 (2) is the common parts provision; and, for the reasons given above, that 
  is of no relevance save in those cases to which it directly applies. In our 
  view Fellowes was rightly decided and its reasoning applies equally to 
  the facts of the present case. 

The distinction which we thus accept between 
  access qua member of the public and access qua visitor may at 
  first sight seem a gloss on the terms of the statute. But, as we have shown, 
  it is well-established by authority: there are indeed several other cases to a 
  similar effect not cited to us (of which perhaps the most helpful is 
  Director of Public Prosecutions v. Vivier [1991] R.T.R. 205). And on 
  closer consideration such a distinction can be seen to be essential if the 
  concept of a "public place" is not to lose touch with ordinary usage and with 
  important liberties. If every householder's front garden was a "public place" 
  by reason only of the fact that the postman or the Jehovah's witness has an 
  implied invitation to make their way to the front door, the result would be 
  that not only could he not keep his dangerous dog outside but that he could 
  neither carry a knife within his own curtilage nor enjoy the pleasure of being 
  drunk and disorderly on his own front lawn. 

We should mention two submissions advanced by Mr 
  Worsley, though they formed no part of the reasoning of the Recorder. 

His first submission was that the only question 
  under the definition is whether there was any physical barrier to members of 
  the public accessing the "place" in question: if not, then members of the 
  public will "have access" even if they may not be "permitted to have access". 
  That cannot be right. Whatever the precise effect of the formula "have or are 
  permitted to have", it certainly does not mean that any place that a member of 
  the public can physically access, however obviously private it may be, is a 
  public place: otherwise every front drive that was not barred by a gate would 
  be a public place. 

His second submission was that the fact that 
  Sycamore House was a care home meant, or in any event might mean, that the 
  driveway giving access to it was  again using Sedley LJ's phrase  "on the 
  face of it public". We do not accept this. There are of course many kinds of 
  commercial or institutional premises to which members of the public, or a 
  class of members of the public, have access as such  examples from the 
  decided cases include football grounds, public car-parks, shops, and places of 
  entertainment  but not every institution is of that character. The borderline 
  between public and private places may not always be easy to define, and there 
  will be some doubtful cases. But we cannot see that it is arguable that the 
  public as such has access to a private care home  or, still less, to a 
  driveway leading to such a home through a private garden. 

We must accordingly allow this appeal and quash Mr 
  Bogdal's conviction on all three counts. We appreciate that the effect of our 
  doing so is that in cases of the present kind, where occupiers of neighbouring 
  private properties and their visitors have the use of shared access paths or 
  roads, users of such common access will not have the protection of the 
  provisions of the 1991 Act (though they may of course have other protections 
  including under the Dogs Act 1871). But Parliament chose, for reasons that we 
  can understand, to limit the effects of the Act to cases where dogs are let 
  out of control in a "public place" (using a well-tried statutory definition) 
  even though, as the facts of the present case and of Fellowes show, 
  dangerous dogs may also be a menace in private places. It may be anomalous 
  that one particular kind of private space  namely the common parts of a 
  building shared by more than one dwelling  should have been specially brought 
  within the statutory definition when others are not; but this is a notoriously 
  ill-conceived statute, and it is not for us to seek to re-draft it. 

However, we wish in conclusion strongly to 
  encourage Mr and Mrs Bogdal to take steps (if they have not already done so) 
  to ensure that there is no repetition of the incidents which gave rise to the 
  prosecution and that the dog in question does not pose a risk to legitimate 
  users of the driveway serving Wawne House and Sycamore House. The fact that 
  that driveway is not a public place does not mean that they may not incur 
  civil liabilities arising out of its behaviour or get into trouble with the 
  law in other ways than under the 1991 Act. 

With the quashing of the conviction the appeal 
  against sentence becomes redundant. 

THE JUDICIAL REVIEW APPLICATION
Since Mrs Bogdal's challenge was to the terms of 
  the requirement imposed on Mr Bogdal under sec. 190 of the 2003 Act the 
  quashing of his conviction also removes the need for any relief; and, sitting 
  as a Divisional Court, we accordingly make no substantive order on her 
  application. If Mrs Bogdal seeks any consequential order, she should lodge 
  written representations with the Administrative Court within 14 days of the 
  hand-down date of this judgment.

[
	LORD JUSTICE TOULSON:  On 4th July 2003 at Sheffield Crown Court before His Honour Judge Lawler QC, the appellant was convicted by a majority of rape (counts 1 to 6) and indecent assault (counts 7 to 10).  He was subsequently sentenced to 12 years' imprisonment concurrent for the offences of rape and 4 years' imprisonment concurrent for the offences of indecent assault.  He appeals against conviction by leave of the full court. 

 
	It will be appreciated from the dates recited that this is a very stale appeal.  The reasons for its staleness were considered by the full court when granting leave and need not be repeated.

 
	The complainant, "J", was the appellant's stepdaughter.  On 1st November 2002 she told the police that he had sexually abused her on numerous occasions between 1982 and 1989 when she was aged between 8 and 14 years old.  The counts on the indictment were all specimen counts.

 
	The complainant was five years old when her mother married the appellant.  Living also in the house from that time on were the complainant's sister and brother.  She said that she did not tell anyone what happened to her during the years of abuse because she was frightened and did not want to upset her mother.

 
	Her evidence was that from the age of about 8 the appellant sexually abused her on a regular basis day and night.  The abuse often took place while she was in bed with her sister, but her sister never woke up.  She said that the abuse stopped in 1989 when she was 14 years old because she was then able to stand up to the appellant.  She carried on living at home with her mother and the appellant until she was 21 years old.  In 1995 she left home.  In 1998 she was married and the appellant gave her away at her wedding.  In the following year, the appellant and the complainant's mother separated and the appellant began living with another woman, whom he later married and who gave evidence on his behalf at the trial.

 
	In September 2000 the complainant said something to her mother about the way in which her stepfather had allegedly treated her.  By now the appellant was the mother of two young children, the second of whom was just 4 months old.  Under pressure from her mother, the complainant told her husband.  She then underwent a period of counselling.  This was two years or so before she made a complaint to the police, following which the appellant was arrested and interviewed.  He denied the allegations in their entirety throughout his interview and throughout his evidence at the trial.

 
	The appellant was given leave to appeal on four grounds.  Ultimately, this appeal turns on one point which is short but far from easy.  First, we must deal with the others.

 
	The first ground of appeal was that the record of the police interviews with the appellant were not edited, as they should have been, to exclude allegations of the complainant which he she did not maintain in the witness box, and prejudicial irrelevant material about the appellant's relationship with his current wife.  As to the first, in interview it had been put to the appellant that the complainant said, among other things, that he used to caress her body and kiss her in an adult fashion.  That part of the alleged abuse did not emerge in her evidence, and so should strictly have been edited from the interview before it went before the jury.  However, that form of abuse was much less grave than much of the abuse about which the complainant did give evidence, and it is, in our judgment, simply unrealistic to suppose that the omission to edit that part had any prejudicial effect in leading to the jury's verdicts.

 
	The second part of the interview about which complaint is made was a short passage where the interviewing officer elicited the fact that the appellant's current wife was aged 18 when they met, and he suggested that this indicated that the appellant had a preference for younger women.  Nobody could sensibly think that there was any relevant comparison to be drawn between an adult male entering into a relationship with a woman of 18 and engaging in paedophile activities with a stepchild of 8 to 14.  The question was certainly irrelevant, but we cannot suppose that it could realistically have affected the jury's verdict.  Experienced trial counsel took the view that it was too innocuous to require exersion, and that was a realistic view.

 
	The second ground of appeal is that the judge failed to direct the jury as to the legal status of the evidence of the complainant having spoken to her mother in September 2000 about the appellant's alleged conduct towards her.  In her evidence in-chief, the complainant was asked if, during the period of the alleged abuse, she had ever mentioned it to anyone else.  She confirmed that she had not.  In cross-examination, counsel for the appellant drew out the fact that she had first mentioned the matter to her mother.  This was a perfectly understandable form of cross-examination.  Counsel for the appellant was wanting to draw out before the jury the full length of the delay before the complainant had mentioned this matter to anybody.  In order to do that, it was necessary to find out from the witness to whom she had first spoken.  That then led to him developing a line of argument to the effect that the appellant and her mother had had a volatile relationship.  They fell out again in relation to what she had said to her mother.  At about the same time her mother was falling out with her stepfather.  In short, the complainant was in a state of some emotional turmoil, and surrounded by unstable relationships, at the time when she first came out with the matter.  The defence were also anxious to find out from the complainant what it was that supposedly caused her first to mention it to her mother.  All this, as already mentioned, was in the context of her own change of domestic circumstances, in that she was now a young mother coping with all the emotional and physical stresses of childbirth and the aftermath.

 
	There is authority, to which Mr Barlow has taken us, to the effect that whenever evidence comes out at a trial on charges of sexual offences about a complaint having been made, the judge should direct the jury about the limited relevance of such evidence.  The obvious reason why this has been seen as necessary is because in cases of so-called recent complaint a jury might otherwise treat what the complainant is said to have said to others as somehow reinforcing the quality of the evidence given by the complainant herself or himself.

 
	In this context, the fact of the report was brought out for entirely different reasons.  It was in no sense a recent complaint, and the jury were told nothing about the details of it, because it was not material.  In our judgment, it is unnecessary for this court to decide whether, under the line of authorities to which we have referred, it was incumbent on the judge to give the jury a direction about the potential significance of this evidence, in circumstances where nobody was putting it forward as evidence which in any way positively supported the prosecution's case, and, as we have mentioned, no details of what she had said had been given to the jury.  If there had been such a direction, it would have been to the effect that the only relevance of what they had heard about the complainant's recounting of matters to her mother in September 2000 was in relation to the question of whether her delay in doing so undermined or weakened the jury's confidence in the accuracy of her evidence.  But it is plain from the transcript of the proceedings and the summing-up as a whole that that is the way in which that issue was approached by everybody involved in the case.  We can see no serious basis for supposing that the omission of such a direction can in any way have affected the result.

 
	Grounds three and four are of a different ambit.  It is complained that the judge failed to direct the jury in respect of the inconsistencies in the account provided by the complainant, and the judge made unfair comments during his summing-up.  It is convenient to take those two together.

 
	What have been described as inconsistencies in the accounts provided by the complainant were not contradictions, but were instances where the complainant said things in her evidence which she had not said in her previous statement.  In each case the point was drawn to the jury's attention by the judge in the course of his narrative summary of her evidence, without further comment.  But the judge gave no direction to the jury as to how they should approach those matters.

 
	The real complaint is that the summing-up was unbalanced because the judge made certain remarks which were positively supportive of the prosecution's case, and could have left the jury in no doubt what he thought about the facts, and that those comments were not balanced by any reciprocal underlining of points made by the defence so as to give the jury a balanced presentation.

 
	This was a case in which the trial had been short and closing speeches had been delivered on the same day as the summing-up by experienced counsel, who had made, succinctly, all the major points which were to be made on either side.  Unusually, we have transcripts of those closing speeches.  The task for the judge in these circumstances was essentially a simple one.  All that he needed to do was give the jury the necessary directions of law and to remind them of the salient evidence and the issues in the case.  It was not necessary for him to go further into reiteration of arguments in favour of the prosecution or the defence, and, in the view of this court, there was very good reason in such circumstances not to do so.  He was, of course, entitled to make comments, but, if so, it was necessary to ensure that it was done in a balanced fashion.

 
	Mr Barlow identified a number of the points which had been made on behalf of the appellant.  The main points were these: 

 
  There was no independent evidence to support the complainant's account. 

 
  It was strange that the abuse should have carried on in the family home for six years with the regularity that she alleged but without detection or suspicion falling on the appellant. 

 
  It was remarkable that on the complainant's account she suffered no visible injury or bleeding, although the prosecution alleged forced intercourse at the age of 8.  Had there been bleeding, her mother, who did the washing, might have been expected to wonder why her daughter's pants were bloodstained.  But on the complainant's account she never did bleed until she started her periods, and that was after the abuse had finished. 

 
  The complainant had remained living at home until the age of 21. 

 
  The appellant had given her away at her wedding. 

 
  A number of things said by the complainant in her evidence emerged then for the first time, as we have already mentioned. 

 
  There was a delay of well over a decade before the complainant made any mention of the alleged abuse to anyone. 

 
	Mr Hillis, who had the misfortune of receiving the prosecution's brief only late last night, used the intervening hours constructively, because in his helpful submissions he analysed these various points and showed that each of them was dealt with by the judge in the course of his summing-up.  They may not have been emphasised, but they were points about which argument had been presented on the appellant's behalf by his trial counsel and they were dealt with by the judge in his summing-up.  It is also right to note that the judge, when he came to remind the jury of the appellant's evidence, did so largely (although not entirely) without adverse comment.

 
	The problem is not in truth that the judge failed to mention any material point which the appellant says ought to have been put to the jury.  The concern is the disparate treatment given to the evidence and points made on behalf of the complainant and the appellant.

 
	One of the points made by counsel for the prosecution was the absence of any obvious motive for the complainant to lie.  This was a fair point for the prosecutor to make, and she made it vigorously but without going over the top.  In her closing address to the jury, counsel for prosecution said as follows: 

 
"Members of the jury, I would invite you to consider this question.  Why on earth should the liar be [the complainant]?  What on earth does [the complainant] stand to gain from telling a pack of wicked, shameless lies?  Don't get me wrong, ladies and gentlemen.  I am not trying to go behind that principle I told you about right at the very start, the burden and the standard of proof.  Don't think for a moment that I am suggesting the defence have to provide a reason for you to believe why [the complainant] should lie, but you may think it wouldn't half help.  [The complainant] has never been described in fact by anybody other than herself as a difficult teenager, a habitual liar.  To be fair to her, she didn't say that about herself; she said she was a proper little madam and a bit of a rebellious teenager.  But nobody has said, 'This is a girl who you could never believe a single word she said.  She was always lying her head off'.  It has never been suggested to her by anybody, 'Oh, you're lying for this reason, that reason or the other reason', or 'You could be lying for any of those reasons'.  So why on earth should she?  
If we are going to tell lies we usually have a reason for it.  We don't usually do it just for the sake of it.  If we are telling lies, we usually don't do it in such a way that makes us look rather bad, such as describing yourself as a bit of a teenage rebel and a proper little madam.  Yet [the complainant] says 'That was me as a teenager'. Bizarrely, you may think, [the appellant] is saying, 'No, she was fine.  She's got a brilliant personality.  I really got on with her, no problems with her'. 
Members of the jury, just think what [the complainant] has put herself through for the sake of these lies, as the defence would have you accept." 
	That was the closing note to the prosecution's address.  The judge picked the point up.  It was proper for him to refer to it, because it was a major part of the prosecution's case.  But the complaint made is that in his summing up he made the same point time and again, without setting it against any other factors.  At page 148 of the transcript of the trial, he said: 

 
"I now move to another area, which is when the abuse ceased.  She told you that was when she was 14.  The effect of her evidence was that she had gained in confidence and began to say no.  [Her brother] was also at home rather more of the time.  She said the defendant did stop, but he tried it on and pestered her for sex when he saw the opportunity.  She resisted those advances.  He did not pursue her physically or threaten her.  
Now, it is a matter for you, members of the jury, but you will have to ask: if she is lying about all of this, why did she choose this particular time to say the abuse stopped?  She could, if she is lying about it, have said it went on for another few years.  That is a matter for you." 
Two pages on, after referring to the delay in reporting the appellant's alleged treatment of the complainant and telling the jury that experience has shown that sometimes children keep quiet for fear of the consequences within the family setting, he went on to say: 
"Members of the jury, it is a matter for you, but you will have to ask whether she would have put herself through all that mental anguish if she was lying about this whole thing." 
Two pages on he said this: 
"Equally, members of the jury - and this is another matter which the Crown invite you to consider - if all was well and he was the caring stepfather, why has she not only made but followed through these allegations to this court?  The defence, I remind you, do not have to establish a motive for why she should say these things.  It is for the prosecution to prove their case, but the prosecution invite you to consider this matter and the absence of any motive put to [the complainant].  The Crown say to you, 'What has she to gain?'" 
Another three pages on, when going through the appellant's evidence, the judge made the same point again.
	It is said that nobody on the jury listening to that repeated theme could have been left in any doubt but that the judge, for his part, was impressed by the complainant's credibility.  It is said that the vice running through the way in which the judge dealt with this point, which had already been firmly made by the prosecution, was that he came back to it again and again as a refrain in between dealing with other aspects of the evidence, and that this was to unbalance the summing-up by constant repetition of the point.  Furthermore, it was not balanced by reminding the jury that not all sexual complaints are necessarily true, or by inviting them in this context to consider any of the various defence points which he had mentioned at different stages when reminding the jury of the evidence, or making reference to her own circumstances at the time when she first brought these matters to light.

 
	We have found this a difficult matter.  It is more than likely that the judge delivering his summing-up did not realise quite how often he was repeating the point.  But each member of the court, on reading the summing-up, has been troubled by the drum like repetition of the point.  Cases involving allegations of historical sexual abuse are always difficult, especially where there is no material independent evidence to support either side.  It is proper for the judge to remind the jury, as he did in this case, that there may be understandable reasons why child abuse does not come to light until many years afterwards, and the fact that a complaint is unsupported by other evidence is not of itself an indication that the evidence is untrue.  But balance has to be preserved.  We have been driven to the regretful conclusion that this summing-up was not balanced and that the resulting convictions are unsafe.  We recognise that this is deeply unsatisfactory, coming some years after the event.  This court will always hesitate long before overturning a conviction based on a jury's assessment of the truthfulness of witnesses whom it has seen.  But there is a principle at stake.  Whatever the nature of the case, the summing-up has to be balanced.  As already indicated, we rather suspect that the judge may not himself have appreciated, as he was delivering this summing-up, how much he was emphasising the case advanced by the prosecution without reference to other factors which the jury had to take properly into account.  For those reasons, this appeal must be allowed.

 
	MR HILLIS:  My Lord, for the sake of completeness we ask my Lord to confirm that my Lord does not regard this matter as suitable for retrial.

 
	LORD JUSTICE TOULSON:  No, the appellant has served 6 years' imprisonment.  On a case of this kind it would be wholly improper for this court to express any views as to merits.  We do understand that from the complainant's point of view the result is unsatisfactory because she has given her evidence and been believed and now the conviction is being quashed with no retrial, but it would be wholly wrong to order a retrial in circumstances where the appellant has served 6 years' imprisonment.

 
	MR HILLIS:  I am obliged, my Lord.

	LORD JUSTICE TOULSON:  On 4th July 2003 at Sheffield Crown Court before His Honour Judge Lawler QC, the appellant was convicted by a majority of rape (counts 1 to 6) and indecent assault (counts 7 to 10).  He was subsequently sentenced to 12 years' imprisonment concurrent for the offences of rape and 4 years' imprisonment concurrent for the offences of indecent assault.

[The complainant] has never been described in fact by anybody other than herself as a difficult teenager, a habitual liar.  To be fair to her, she didn't say that about herself; she said she was a proper little madam and a bit of a rebellious teenager.  But nobody has said, 'This is a girl who you could never believe a single word she said.  She was always lying her head off'.  It has never been suggested to her by anybody, 'Oh, you're lying for this reason, that reason or the other reason', or 'You could be lying for any of those reasons'.  So why on earth should she?  
If we are going to tell lies we usually have a reason for it.  We don't usually do it just for the sake of it.  If we are telling lies, we usually don't do it in such a way that makes us look rather bad, such as describing yourself as a bit of a teenage rebel and a proper little madam.  Yet [the complainant] says 'That was me as a teenager'. Bizarrely, you may think, [the appellant] is saying, 'No, she was fine.  She's got a brilliant personality.  I really got on with her, no problems with her'. 
Members of the jury, just think what [the complainant] has put herself through for the sake of these lies, as the defence would have you accept." 
	That was the closing note to the prosecution's address.  The judge picked the point up.  It was proper for him to refer to it, because it was a major part of the prosecution's case.  But the complaint made is that in his summing up he made the same point time and again, without setting it against any other factors.  At page 148 of the transcript of the trial, he said: 

 
"I now move to another area, which is when the abuse ceased.  She told you that was when she was 14.  The effect of her evidence was that she had gained in confidence and began to say no.  [Her brother] was also at home rather more of the time.  She said the defendant did stop, but he tried it on and pestered her for sex when he saw the opportunity.  She resisted those advances.  He did not pursue her physically or threaten her.  
Now, it is a matter for you, members of the jury, but you will have to ask: if she is lying about all of this, why did she choose this particular time to say the abuse stopped?  She could, if she is lying about it, have said it went on for another few years.  That is a matter for you." 
Two pages on, after referring to the delay in reporting the appellant's alleged treatment of the complainant and telling the jury that experience has shown that sometimes children keep quiet for fear of the consequences within the family setting, he went on to say: 
"Members of the jury, it is a matter for you, but you will have to ask whether she would have put herself through all that mental anguish if she was lying about this whole thing." 
Two pages on he said this: 
"Equally, members of the jury - and this is another matter which the Crown invite you to consider - if all was well and he was the caring stepfather, why has she not only made but followed through these allegations to this court?  The defence, I remind you, do not have to establish a motive for why she should say these things.  It is for the prosecution to prove their case, but the prosecution invite you to consider this matter and the absence of any motive put to [the complainant].  The Crown say to you, 'What has she to gain?'" 
Another three pages on, when going through the appellant's evidence, the judge made the same point again.
	It is said that nobody on the jury listening to that repeated theme could have been left in any doubt but that the judge, for his part, was impressed by the complainant's credibility.  It is said that the vice running through the way in which the judge dealt with this point, which had already been firmly made by the prosecution, was that he came back to it again and again as a refrain in between dealing with other aspects of the evidence, and that this was to unbalance the summing-up by constant repetition of the point.  Furthermore, it was not balanced by reminding the jury that not all sexual complaints are necessarily true, or by inviting them in this context to consider any of the various defence points which he had mentioned at different stages when reminding the jury of the evidence, or making reference to her own circumstances at the time when she first brought these matters to light.

 
	We have found this a difficult matter.  It is more than likely that the judge delivering his summing-up did not realise quite how often he was repeating the point.  But each member of the court, on reading the summing-up, has been troubled by the drum like repetition of the point.  Cases involving allegations of historical sexual abuse are always difficult, especially where there is no material independent evidence to support either side.  It is proper for the judge to remind the jury, as he did in this case, that there may be understandable reasons why child abuse does not come to light until many years afterwards, and the fact that a complaint is unsupported by other evidence is not of itself an indication that the evidence is untrue.  But balance has to be preserved.  We have been driven to the regretful conclusion that this summing-up was not balanced and that the resulting convictions are unsafe.  We recognise that this is deeply unsatisfactory, coming some years after the event.  This court will always hesitate long before overturning a conviction based on a jury's assessment of the truthfulness of witnesses whom it has seen.  But there is a principle at stake.  Whatever the nature of the case, the summing-up has to be balanced.  As already indicated, we rather suspect that the judge may not himself have appreciated, as he was delivering this summing-up, how much he was emphasising the case advanced by the prosecution without reference to other factors which the jury had to take properly into account.  For those reasons, this appeal must be allowed.

 
	MR HILLIS:  My Lord, for the sake of completeness we ask my Lord to confirm that my Lord does not regard this matter as suitable for retrial.

 
	LORD JUSTICE TOULSON:  No, the appellant has served 6 years' imprisonment.  On a case of this kind it would be wholly improper for this court to express any views as to merits.  We do understand that from the complainant's point of view the result is unsatisfactory because she has given her evidence and been believed and now the conviction is being quashed with no retrial, but it would be wholly wrong to order a retrial in circumstances where the appellant has served 6 years' imprisonment.

 
	MR HILLIS:  I am obliged, my Lord.

Lord Justice Rix:


This appeal concerns, as its primary ground, a novel and interesting point about the recent provisions governing the admissibility of bad character under the Criminal Justice Act 2003. Following a plea of guilty to manslaughter, are previous convictions of (relatively low level) violence admissible to prove the specific intent of the offence of murder? There is also a second ground of appeal, which concerns the manner in which the judge directed the jury concerning the appellant's lies in interview.

 

The appellant is Lee David Bullen, now 23, who on 17 October 2006 at the Crown Court at Maidstone before HH Judge Patience QC and a jury was convicted of the murder of Drew Shepherd. He was sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum term of 15 years less 253 days spent in custody on remand. He appeals against conviction with the limited leave of the single judge. At the conclusion of the hearing, the appeal was allowed. These are our reasons for allowing the appeal.

 

At the start of the trial, the appellant pleaded guilty to manslaughter, which was added to the indictment as count 2. The issue for the jury, therefore, was simply whether he had intended to kill or cause grievous bodily harm, and thus been guilty of murder. There was no other issue. His defence was lack of specific intent and he relied on his drunkenness. He had hit the deceased in the neck with a broken beer bottle which had penetrated the jugular vein. The appellant did not give evidence, but he had answered questions in interview.

 

The death of Drew Shepherd occurred in a drunken fight early in the morning of 3 February 2006, after an afternoon and evening of socialising. The appellant and his friend John Towers, with their respective girlfriends, had started off in a pub, where they had met the deceased and his girlfriend. The deceased was a friend of John Towers but previously unknown to the appellant. The same group reassembled in Towers' girlfriend's home later that evening, with the addition of another of the deceased's friends, Steve Lapping. The group consumed quantities of alcohol and other drugs. At about 1 am Towers offered the deceased, his girlfriend and Lapping a lift home. The appellant joined them. Lapping was dropped off first and did not witness what was to happen later. He was not aware of any tension in the car. 

 

The fight started after the group had got out of Towers' car close to the deceased's home. There was uncontradicted evidence from Towers that the deceased had struck the first blow; but there was also evidence from the deceased's girlfriend that during the journey the appellant had become cocky and flirtatious and had asked for a kiss. However, the evening as a whole had been friendly, she said. There were loose beer bottles in the footwell of the car, and when the appellant got out of the car he was holding one. 

 

Everyone was more or less drunk. A fight began between the deceased and the appellant. Only Towers saw it start, with two blows from the deceased on the appellant: when the deceased came towards the appellant again, the latter struck him with the bottle in his hand and smashed it against his head. The two men were in the middle of the road, on the ground, hitting one another, the deceased on his knees, on top or leaning over the appellant. Towers hauled the deceased up first, and the appellant then got up. Towers saw blood on both of them. The fight resumed. It moved from the middle of the road to its side, and ended up by a wall on which the deceased sat, generally unresponsive, while the appellant punched him repeatedly as his girlfriend tried to protect him.

 

The forensic evidence suggested that the fatal wound had been inflicted in the middle of the road, at the start of the fight, for that was where most of the broken glass and blood was to be found; but that inference was not common ground. 

 

Apart from Towers and the deceased's girlfriend, the other witnesses of the fight were local residents looking out of their windows, some at least of whom had been woken up from their sleep. None of them saw the start of the fight. No one described the fatal blow.

 

There was evidence of things said by the appellant at various stages of the fight, such as "I've done a number on you", or "You're lucky. I could" (or "should") "have stamped on your head", or "That's what you get when you", or "I could have kicked his head in". The word "stab" was also heard.

 

Towers took the appellant away by car, back to their girlfriends' home. He had not realised how badly injured the deceased had been when they left the scene. 

 

The pathologist certified the cause of death as the most serious of three stab wounds at the neck, the fatal one being 5 cms deep, penetrating the jugular vein. The base of the beer bottle made a precise mechanical fit in the area of the neck wounds, consistent with a jabbing or stabbing with a broken bottle. The pattern of injuries could not have been caused if the bottle had shattered as it went in, or by an unbroken bottle. At least moderate force would have been required. The angle of entry was horizontal at 90 degrees to the neck. Other injuries were consistent with falling over bits of broken glass.      

 

There was also evidence about the intoxication of both the deceased and the appellant. The deceased had an alcohol level of 305 mgs per 100 ml of blood, a level associated with extreme drunkenness in an ordinary social drinker. The back calculation performed on the appellant's blood alcohol content after his arrest demonstrated that at the time of the fight his level would have been 235 mgs per 100 ml. Any figure above 200 would be associated with a significant degree of drunkenness in the normal drinker. 

 

The appellant was found asleep at 0530 that morning and arrested. At interview, the appellant initially denied having a bottle. At a subsequent interview, he accepted having a bottle and using it, saying that he swung it round and hit the side of the deceased's head, in the area of the ear, when it smashed to pieces, leaving nothing in his hands. The prosecution said that these amounted to two lies: the first, that he never had a bottle at all, and the second, that he was never left with a broken bottle in his hand.

 


The ruling on the admission of bad character


At a time when the appellant had not yet accepted manslaughter responsibility for the death of the deceased, the Crown gave notice of intention to adduce bad character evidence pursuant to section 101(1)(d) of the 2003 Act. The notice was served in response to the anticipation that the appellant was claiming that he acted in self-defence. The notice set out the details of 8 previous convictions. One prosecution had in fact failed: ultimately only 7 previous convictions were admitted. The notice asserted that these previous convictions were relevant because they showed "that the defendant has a propensity to be violent" and "to determine whether or not the defendant was acting in lawful self-defence." In three of the previous convictions, the appellant had originally claimed self-defence; in one of the previous 7, a glass had been used and this was also relevant to "whether the defendant was acting in lawful self defence". 

 

The offences for which the appellant had been convicted had occurred between 22 June 2000 and 13 November 2005. He had pleaded guilty on six of the seven occasions. The judge was to sum up these convictions to the jury at length, over the space of two and a half pages of the transcript. There were seven convictions, but one of them involved four offences, so there were in all ten offences. The four earlier appearances were in a youth court, and the three later appearances were in a magistrates' court. The guilty pleas were to: an offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm (a punch to a shop-keeper); an offence of assaulting a police officer in the execution of his duty (kicking and lashing out at police officers and a nurse while in police custody); an offence of using threatening words or behaviour with intent to cause fear of violence (punching a woman at a railway station and threatening to cut a man who intervened on her behalf); an offence of common assault (throwing a piece of wood which hit its target, in the course of a neighbour dispute); another offence of common assault (punching a woman in the face after he had been ejected for drunkenness from a pub and he began kicking the front door and she said she was going to call the police); and a third offence of common assault (punching his 18 year old brother in an argument). The last three offences occurred in 2005, the first three in 2000/2001: the appellant was then aged 15 to 21. He was 22 at the time of his trial for murder. 

 

The four offences to which he pleaded not guilty arose out of a single incident in June 2002: the appellant was swearing in a public place, a lady asked him to stop, he grabbed her by the throat and punched her, her 16 year-old son intervened and was also punched, her husband intervened and was struck over the head with the glass in his hand, which broke. He was convicted of offences of actual bodily harm, two common assaults and affray.

 

The Crown persevered at trial in its application to admit evidence of these previous convictions, even though there was no longer any issue of self-defence, for the appellant had accepted that he was guilty of manslaughter. The Crown continued to submit that these offences demonstrated "a propensity on the part of the appellant to commit acts of violence which therefore made it more likely than might otherwise have been the case that the defendant was guilty of murder". The defence submitted that none of these convictions were for offences of specific intent and showed no more than a tendency to behave violently. The judge ruled in favour of the Crown's application. The judge addressed himself thus to the three questions posed by the Vice-President, Lord Justice Rose, in R v. Hanson [2005] 2 Cr App R 21 at para 7:

 

"One: does the history of convictions establish a propensity to commit offences of the kind charged? In my judgment they did; they were offences of violence, involving, in some cases, the use, or threat of use of weapons, committed sometimes in drink, and all, save in one instance to which I have referred, deliberate acts.

Secondly: did the propensity make it more likely that the defendant committed the offence of murder? In my judgment, it was open to the jury to conclude that they did, after receiving a proper direction, and considering the matter in the appropriate context, and of course, against the background of the whole of the evidence in this case.

Thirdly: is it right to rely on these convictions and will the proceedings be unfair if they are admitted? In my judgment, both questions fell to be answered in the negative; these matters were not so prejudicial or scandalous as to cloud the issue before the jury, or to lead them to an adverse verdict, without a proper consideration of the whole of the evidence."


The judge's directions to the jury


It is not clear from the judge's ruling exactly how he considered that the previous convictions threw relevant light on the issue of specific intent before the jury at trial. However, he acknowledged the need for the jury to receive a proper direction which would assist them to see the evidence of bad character in the appropriate context. It is important, therefore, to see how he did direct the jury with regard to that evidence and the issue of specific intent which was before them.

 

There is no doubt that the judge directed the jury about the issue of intent impeccably. Early in his summing-up he identified it as "the live issuearound his state of mind; what he intended, when he struck Drew Shepherd in the neck with that broken bottle" (at transcript 1, page 11C); and late in his summing-up, after emphasising that the infliction of the fatal blow with the broken bottle was admitted, he spoke of the issue  again, saying "you have got to decidewhy he did it, what was in his mind" (transcript 2, pages 46H/47A).  The judge began by telling the jury that an intent can be maintained for a long time, or formed suddenly, as in bad temper. He then proceeded to assist them as to how they might form a judgment about intent, viz by looking at what the defendant was "saying and doing before, at the time of, and indeed after the act that lead to Drew Shepherd's death". Thus, questions which might occur to the jury to ask themselves, if they found it helpful, might be: What weapon was used? Where the deceased was struck? What the appellant's purpose was in doing as he did? Whether the appellant had proceeded to attack the deceased further when he was sitting on the wall, and, if so, why? What was he heard to say? Finally, he directed the jury in standard terms about the significance of drunkenness to the question of intent. 

 

Nowhere in this direction, which covered four pages of the transcript, did the judge mention the appellant's previous convictions as throwing any possible light on the issue of intent. But a little later in his summing-up, albeit separated from his directions on intent by further directions dealing with the drunkenness or sleepiness of various witnesses and with the significance of the evidence of the forensic experts, the judge turned to "Another matter of law, entirely separate, but very important" (emphasis added), namely the matter of previous convictions. We have already set out above the essence of that evidence of bad character. It is necessary, however, to set out in full the rest of the judge's directions on this subject matter, emphasising certain further parts of them. He said 

 

"Another matter of law, entirely separate, but very important: you may have wondered why it was that you heard evidence of previous convictions recorded against the defendant: in other words, that he has what the lawyers call a bad character, in the sense that he has criminal convictions recorded against him. Members of the jury, I will remind you of what those facts were, so that you have them in mind, if you were not able to follow them, and then give you directions as to how you should approach that evidence because it is very important that you understand why you heard that evidence, and what use you should make of them

Members of the jury, those matters were not put before you in that detail just, as it were, to aggravate the defendant's situation, or make it worse, or still less to prejudice you. That is not the purpose of your hearing that material. It is important, as I have said, that you understand why you have heard this evidence, and how you can use it. It is also highly important that you keep in mind that you must not convict Lee Bullen of murder only because he has this bad character. The evidence of these offences may help you to resolve an issue that has arisen between the Crown on the one hand, and the defence on the other; namely, whether this defendant has a propensity that is to say a tendency, to commit violent offences of the kind with which he is now charged because, of course, murder is a violent offence, like the offences you have heard about in this history. 

If you think it right, you may take the previous convictions into account in deciding whether or not Lee Bullen committed the offence of murder. The Crown relies upon them because the Crown argue that the convictions show that Lee Bullen has a tendency to commit acts of violence, sometimes in drink, sometimes involving either the use of a weapon, or the threat to use a weapon. You have to decide whether these convictions do demonstrate such a tendency  that is for you to decide  and if so, whether or not that tendency makes it more likely that he committed the offence of murder which you are trying. You have to decide, in other words, to what extent, if at all, these convictions help you when considering whether or not he is guilty of murder, and considering at the same time the whole of the evidence put before you in reaching that decision. You must not, I repeat, convict simply because of the convictions, nor indeed mainly because of them. The propensity, or tendency, if you find that there is such, amounts to some additional evidence pointing to guilt, but bear in mind, even if you find that Lee Bullen does have such a tendency, it does not necessarily prove that he would commit further offences, or that he has committed this offence which you are trying"


After the jury retired to consider their verdict, they sent the judge a note, which raised three questions:

 

"(1) Can you give us a copy of the legal definition of murder and manslaughter? (2) Can you clarify intention, serious harm(3) Has he admitted self-defence, or said that it wasn't self-defence?"

The judge discussed this note with counsel and overnight prepared a document for the jury, which was handed to the jury, and which he also read into the transcript. He there emphasised that, having pleaded to manslaughter, the appellant had admitted that he had not been acting in lawful self-defence, and that the issue of self-defence therefore did not arise. As for intention, the judge repeated the essence of the full direction that he had given towards the beginning of his summing-up. As before, that direction said nothing whatsoever about how the evidence of bad character could assist the jury, or be taken into account by them, in coming to their view on that single, critical issue. 

We observe that in his direction on the evidence of bad character, the judge had told the jury that it was a matter "entirely separate"; that it was important for them to understand why they had heard that evidence; that the reason was so that they could consider the Crown's submission that it was evidence of a propensity to violence; and that, if they accepted that submission, such a propensity was additional evidence which pointed to guilt of murder. The judge did not explain how an accepted propensity to violence, of the kind indicated by the previous convictions, assisted the jury on the question of murder, which in the circumstances was entirely a question of specific intent. Nothing the judge said on the two occasions when the judge dealt with the question of intent tied it expressly in any way into the evidence of bad character; and vice versa. 

 

 
The Criminal Justice Act 2003


The relevant provisions of the 2003 Act are as follows:

 

"101.  (1) In criminal proceedings evidence of the defendant's bad character is admissible if, but only if, -
  
(d) it is relevant to an important matter in issue between the defendant and the prosecution

(3) The court must not admit evidence under subsection (1)(d) or (g) if, on an application by the defendant to exclude it, it appears to the court that the admission of the evidence would have such an adverse effect on the fairness of the proceedings that the court ought not to admit it.

103. (1) For the purposes of section 101(1)(d) the matters in issue between the defendant and the prosecution include 
(a) the question whether the defendant has a propensity to commit offences of the kind with which he is charged, except where his having such a propensity makes it no more likely that he is guilty of the offence

(2) Where subsection (1)(a) applies, a defendant's propensity to commit offences of the kind with which he is charged may (without prejudice to any other way of doing so) be established by evidence that he has been convicted of -
(a) an offence of the same description as the one with which he is charged, or
(b) an offence of the same category as the one of which he is charged.
 
(3) Subsection (2) does not apply in the case of a particular defendant if the court is satisfied, by reason of the length of time since the conviction or for any other reason, that it would be unjust for it to apply in his case.

(4) For the purposes of subsection (2) 
(a) two offences are of the same description as each other if the statement of the offence in a written charge or indictment would, in each case, be in the same terms;
(b) two offences are of the same category as each other if they belong to the same category of offences prescribed for the purposes of this section by an order made by the Secretary of State."


The submissions on appeal


On behalf of the appellant, Miss McGowan QC, who had also defended him at trial, submitted that the issue at trial was that of specific intent; that, given the plea to manslaughter, the appellant's propensity to violence was not in issue, and certainly not an important matter in issue; the whole actus reus had been proved by the guilty plea; as for the required mens rea of specific intent, all previous convictions had involved offences of only basic intent, and could throw no light on the issue at trial. As for the judge's summing up, he never explained, throughout his lengthy direction on bad character, how that evidence went to the issue before the jury. Nor, in dealing with the appellant's intention, did he see any need to refer to the appellant's bad character. It was never suggested that the basis of the admission of bad character was to show that the appellant would have appreciated from his past conduct that violence was capable of causing really serious physical harm, thus justifying the inference that he must have intended such harm; and in any event none of the previous offences had caused such harm. Since the previous convictions were irrelevant, they could only be unfairly prejudicial. In terms of the statute: the propensity to violence was not an important matter in issue, or a matter in issue at all (section 101(1)(d) and section 103(1)(a)); the appellant's having such a propensity made it no more likely that he was guilty of murder (the proviso to section 103(1)(a)); it would in any event be unjust to apply the statute's definition of "offences of the kind with which he is charged" (section 103(3)). In any event, such evidence had such an adverse effect on the fairness of the proceedings that the court ought not to admit it (section 101(3) and Police and Criminal Evidence Act, 1984, section 78(1)).

 

On behalf of the Crown, Mr Jonathan Higgs, who had also prosecuted at trial, submitted that the evidence was properly admitted and properly explained to the jury. The bad character was not so much relevant to the "legal ingredient" of specific intent as to various factual sub-issues, such as, Who initiated the violence? And, Why was the appellant armed? Although the evidence was that the deceased had started the fighting, there was also evidence that the appellant had provoked trouble by flirting with the deceased's girlfriend in the car. Indeed, he had no need to have gone along for the ride at all, nor to get out of the car when the deceased was dropped off. As a violent man who had used weapons before, the jury were entitled to consider whether he had deliberately set the incident up. Next, Did the appellant realise the bottle was broken and continue to use it? Did he continue to attack once the deceased had ceased to defend himself, and why? Mr Higgs suggested that the bottle broke initially, even before the area in the middle of the road where most of the blood was found. He also suggested that the fatal blow may only have been sustained at the very end, when the deceased was sitting on the wall, not defending himself. Such sub-issues would inform the jury's consideration of the outstanding legal issue of specific intent. None of those factual issues had been addressed by the appellant's guilty plea to the lesser offence. 

 

Moreover, the judge had correctly applied the three questions of Lord Justice Rose from Hanson in his ruling, and directed the jury in standard terms, leaving it to them to say whether the previous convictions did establish a propensity for violence, and warning them not to convict the appellant only or mainly because of his bad character. Although the judge, in dealing in his summing-up with the question of intention, posed different questions to the jury from those posed in these submissions, and did not refer at all in this context to the appellant's previous convictions, it would have given those convictions undue prominence if he had weaved them into his direction on intent: as it was, it was more helpful to the appellant to deal with his previous convictions entirely separately. As for the statute, section 103(2) and (4), by the width of its language, showed a deliberate intention to allow convictions for previous violent offences of only basic intent to figure in a trial charging a more serious offence of specific intent. There was no unfairness in the admission of the disputed evidence. In sum, a record of sustained violence was relevant.

 


Discussion of ground 1: the admissibility of bad character


We think that the judge here erred in principle in admitting this evidence of bad character, without examining sufficiently further what relevant light it could throw on the issue (or sub-issues) at trial. Matters started to go wrong when the notice of intention to adduce bad character evidence, which had been designed to deal with a case of self-defence to which a propensity for violence was clearly relevant, was not rethought or adapted in the light of the plea to manslaughter. The appellant thereby admitted that his use of violence was unlawful. He did not dispute carrying the bottle or using it when broken, or the cause of death. He did not dispute his intoxication, indeed he relied on it. He accepted that on that occasion at least he had been violent in drink. Only his intent was in issue. The judge correctly identified that issue as the critical, indeed the sole substantive issue, for the jury, and he properly directed them on that.

 

In these circumstances, we do not think that a propensity for violence was relevant to or itself an important issue in the trial, if it could be said to be an issue, or relevant to an issue, in the trial at all. The Crown continued to say that it was an issue, and the judge accepted that submission in his ruling and directed the jury accordingly, for both in his ruling and in his summing-up he ascribed the reason why the evidence of the appellant's bad character had been admitted was because it threw light on a propensity to violence, indeed on a "propensity to commit offences of the kindcharged". But neither in his ruling nor in his summing-up did the judge explain any further what he meant by that, or how the bad character was relevant to an important issue between prosecution and defendant, or what issue he had in mind. 

 

It is true that these provisions of the 2003 Act are intended to replace the common law relating to bad character (see section 99(1)), and that the rules of the common law are not to be brought back by a restrictive interpretation of sections 101(1)(d) and 103: see Spencer, Evidence of Bad Character, 2006 at 62-66. Thus, there is no need for "striking similarity" as in DPP v. P [1991] 2 AC 447: see Hanson at para 10. It may also remain true that a defendant who claims he did not commit an offence (for instance of violence) at all but who admits his propensity to violence, may not succeed thereby in keeping out his previous convictions for violence, which may remain relevant to the question of his guilt, possibly because of the degree or nature of his propensity (see Spenser at para 4.25 at 63). Above all, the statutory language is no doubt intended to underline the significance of the complete change from the basic position of the common law, which was that, save for certain, limited, defined exceptions, previous bad character was not prima facie relevant at all to a defendant's guilt. Nevertheless, for all the change in the law, the test is still relevance: see section 101(1)(d) itself, and the introductory language of section 101 itself  "is admissible if, but only if(d) it is relevant to an important matter in issue". The fact that section 103(1) seems also to have the effect of always potentially including the "question of" propensity among "the matters in issue" should not be overstated to the extent that sight is lost of the need for relevance: the bad character must still be relevant to an "important" issue; it will not be a matter in issue at all where the proviso to section 103(1)(a) operates ("except where his having such a propensity makes it no more likely that he is guilty of the offence"), and the safeguard of section 103(4), where it would be "unjust" for previous convictions of the same description or category to be admitted to be used to establish a propensity, itself emphasises the significance of relevance's handmaiden, probative value. Thus it is contemplated that it could be unjust for section 103(2) to apply "by reason of the length of time since the conviction or for any other reason".  Section 101(3), reflecting the rationale of PACE's section 78, also requires a balancing of probative value and undue prejudice to the defendant.

 

No authority has been cited to us regarding the particular problem before this court. We have, however, been referred to para 371 of the Explanatory Notes to the 2003 Act, concerning the proviso to section 103(1)(a), as follows:

 

"Evidence is not, however, admissible on this basis if the existence of such a propensity makes it no more likely that the defendant is guilty. This might be the case where there is no dispute about the facts of the case and the question is whether those facts constitute the offence (for example, in a homicide case, whether the defendant's actions caused death)."

We can see that causation generally lies wholly in the facts of a particular case, and does not depend on a propensity. However, the statutory language is general, as in principle it is bound to be.

We have observed that in R v. Duggan, reported together with R v. Edwards [2005] EWCA Crim 1813, [2006] 1 Cr App R 3 (31), evidence of a previous conviction for an offence of common assault was relied on amongst others for the purpose of proving an offence of wounding with intent. In that case, however, the defendant claimed he was entirely innocent of any wrongdoing at all, blaming the woman he had injured with a bottle for first bumping into him and then moving her glass to his face as though to attack him, as a result of which he merely brought his arm up in self-defence. This court thought that the previous conviction was highly relevant and capable of establishing "propensity to violence relevant to the crucial issue as to who was the aggressor". In our judgment, that has no bearing upon the present appeal. It merely illustrates how the particular circumstances of a previous offence may show a propensity to violence as shedding light on a particular issue in a later trial. 

 

On the contrary, in R v. Leaver [2006] EWCA 2988 (10 November 2006, noted in Archbold 2008 at para 13-65a) the terms in which a previous conviction, for the offence of indecent exposure with intent to insult a female, were left to the jury at a trial where the defendant was charged with rape and causing grievous bodily harm with intent (section 18) led to a successful appeal. That was a case where the previous conviction had been admitted by agreement. So far as the rape count was concerned, there would have been no difficulty if the judge had limited his directions to the jury to a formula agreed with counsel that the previous conviction was relevant to whether the defendant had a propensity to degrade and insult women for his own gratification. However, the judge had gone further than that in his remarks in suggesting that the jury had heard about the previous conviction also for other, in this court's judgment, irrelevant reasons. In particular, the previous conviction had no relevance at all for the section 18 count, on which the defendant had admitted the assault and only put in issue his intent to cause grievous bodily harm. 

 

In the present case, matters in our judgment started to go wrong when the Crown failed to think out anew why they wanted the previous convictions to go in after the plea to manslaughter. That lack of focus is reflected in the judge's ruling, for in his treatment of Lord Justice Rose's three questions he failed to take properly into account the limited nature of the issue at trial and for that purpose the significant fact that the previous convictions had been for offences where neither a specific intent to cause grievous bodily harm nor any causing of grievous bodily harm had been charged or proved. Thus in answering the first question, "1. Does the history of conviction(s) establish a propensity to commit offences of the kind charged?", the judge focussed only on the fact that the offences were offences of violence, sometimes in drink, and in some cases involving the use or threat of use of weapons. He added that save in one instance the violence was "deliberate", but that, in our judgment, was an unsatisfactory and potentially misleading gloss, if it was intended as such, on the concept of specific intent. Even offences of basic intent must be done deliberately (Archbold 2008 at para 17-39a). Given that the issue was not whether the appellant had committed a violent unlawful act causing death, but whether he had the specific intent necessary to murder, the judge should here (or at least elsewhere) have been reminding himself, even while accepting that the appellant's career had certainly showed a propensity for violence, that "a propensity to commit offences of the kind charged" was a deliberately broad concept, properly designed for the generality of cases, but to be handled with care when the sole issue was specific intent. As for "2. Does that propensity make it more likely that the defendant committed the offence charged?", this was the judge's only real opportunity to consider the question of relevance, since he nowhere asked himself the question whether the appellant having the propensity in question is, or is relevant to, an "important" matter in issue (cf Archbold 2008 at para 13-64). The judge answered that question merely by saying that it was open to the jury to conclude that it did, after receiving a proper direction. In our judgment, the judge should have concluded that the answer was No. At any rate, if it was to be Yes, the judge should have explained what light in particular the previous convictions were capable of throwing on the case with which he was concerned. As for "3. Is it unjust to rely on the conviction(s) of the same description or category; and, in any event, will the proceedings be unfair if they are admitted?", the judge said No, on the ground that the previous convictions were not so prejudicial or scandalous as to cloud the issue before the jury. But, if one gets this far, and it is our view that one does not, it does in our judgment seem unjust or unfair to rely on a raft of previous convictions which are not in themselves suggested to throw any light on the issue of intent before the jury. 

 

In this connection, Mr Higgs submits that the previous convictions were relevant to a number of factual sub-issues, even if not to what he calls the "legal ingredient" of specific intent. However, we can find no sign in the proceedings that the previous convictions were presented or deployed in this light or for this purpose. We think that this is really an attempt after the event to find a function for the bad character evidence which they lacked at trial. If this had been the way in which they were deployed, we would have expected to find support for such an analysis in the judge's ruling and summing-up. 

 

That summing-up again reflects the lack of focus at the time of the ruling. We have already observed that the judge's impeccable directions as to the issue of intention were wholly separate from the evidence of bad character. That remained the case when, following the jury's note, the judge returned to the question of intention. Moreover, in dealing with bad character and asking, for the jury's assistance, "why" they had heard that evidence, the judge told them only that it  

 

"may help you to resolve an issue that has arisen between the Crown on the one hand, and the defence on the other; namely whether this defendant has a propensity, that is to say a tendency, to commit violent offences of the kind with which he is now charged because, of course, murder is a violent offence, like the offences you have heard about in his history". 

That is not, however, the way in which Mr Higgs seeks in this appeal to support the admission of the previous convictions. He does not submit that a general propensity to violence made it more likely that the appellant's admitted unlawful assault was on this occasion committed with the specific intent required for murder, but that it supported the Crown's case on particular aspects of their evidence relating to the appellant's intention. Moreover, it is potentially dangerous for the jury to be told that in the instant case previous offences were "of the kind with which he is now charged", even with the further explanation that murder is a violent offence like the offences they had heard about in his past: for that blurs over the critical difference for the purposes of the law and the issue at trial between offences of basic and of specific intent. The statutory language is of course broad in using the concept of "offences of the kind", to allow the possibility of a wide gateway, potentially narrowed by other considerations. But we think that in this passage, subject to his very proper notes of caution, the judge essentially left the jury without any guidance as to how they were to regard or use the lengthy history of previous offending that they had heard about, even though they were positively told that if they found a propensity to violence it "amounts to some additional evidence pointing to guilt".

We would emphasise that the special difficulty in this case is the combination of the narrow issue of intention at trial with the appellant's merely general history, poor as it was, of violence involving only offences of basic intent which had not resulted in grievous bodily harm. The Crown was unable to run a case that his previous history had illustrated the danger of violence as a cause of really serious injury. We are not saying that a more focussed approach might not have been able to identify an (important) issue to which the appellant's bad character was relevant and probative. In particular, the incidents which formed the subject-matter of his convictions on the one occasion he had pleaded not guilty, which had involved the use of a glass, might possibly in some circumstances have been relevantly and fairly deployed. However, for the reasons we have given above, we conclude that on this occasion the judge erred.

 

In these circumstances, Mr Higgs has explicitly accepted on behalf of the Crown that he does not seek to submit that the appeal should nevertheless be dismissed on the ground that the conviction is in any event safe.

 


Ground 2: the lies direction


It follows that ground 2 could not be dispositive; and Miss McGowan said that she did not submit that it would suffice all by itself. We can therefore deal with it briefly. 

 

It will be recalled that two lies were in question: at interview the appellant had first denied having a bottle at all, and subsequently denied having a broken bottle in his hand. 

 

This ground arises out of the terms of the judge's Lucas direction on lies. He said 

 

"why did he lie? That is an important matter for you to consider for this reason: the fact that a lie is told is not, itself, evidence of guilt. Experience teaches us all, does it not, in whatever may be our walks of life, that people will tell lies for very many different reasons. Let me take another one entirely, someone will lie to cover up for someone else, although the liar is not guilty of anything; he is just protecting someone else. Someone will lie because they are frightened, they say the first thing that comes into their head without thinking, or they panic, or they are actually confused. Members of the jury, if any some such innocent reason in that sense is, or may be the explanation for any lies you find that the defendant has told, then of course they will not help you. 

But if you come to the conclusion that the reason, the only reason, or a significant reason for the defendant telling a lie was to cover up what he had done, namely, deliberately to thrust a broken bottle into the neck of Drew Shepherd, intending at least to cause him really serious harm, then of course the lie would add, would it not, as a matter of common sense, very considerable weight to the case for the Crown? So remember always the two stage approach: am I sure a lie was told by the defendant, and if so, what was the reason? Why did he tell that lie? Is it, or may it be the case that the lie was told for an innocent reason in the sense that I have illustrated to you?"    


The difficulty with that direction, Miss McGowan submits, is that it fails to put before the jury the most realistic of possible explanations for the appellant's lies, other than his own consciousness of guilt on the charge of murder, which was that he knew he was guilty of the assault causing the deceased's death, albeit not of the charge of murder, and that he was therefore trying to distance himself from the death as a whole. Mr Higgs submits, on the other hand, that the lies were told when the appellant knew that the police were investigating not just a death, but a murder, and that, because the appellant gave no evidence himself, the jury had nothing from him as to why he had lied, other than to protect himself from his guilt to murder.

 

In our judgment, Miss McGowan's submission is cogent. Even though the appellant gave no evidence, the possibility inherent in the facts of the case was that the appellant would have wished to distance himself from the death as far as he could: for the very reason that he was, at the very least, guilty of manslaughter, as he came belatedly to accept. This may not have been an "innocent" reason like covering up for someone else, or speaking out of panic, fear or confusion, but it would be a matter for the jury to consider whether it was nevertheless an innocent reason so far as the charge of murder was concerned. We think that the judge should to this extent have assisted the jury with this example, while reminding the jury that they had not heard from the appellant on this question, especially as the jury may well not have appreciated that even a fear of acknowledging a lesser guilt may stand as an "innocent" reason for these purposes.  This is in our judgment an example where a direction tailored to the specific circumstances of the particular case is more valuable than a formulaic repetition of a necessarily standard and general exemplar.

 


Conclusion


It was for these reasons that at the end of the hearing of this appeal we ruled that the appeal be allowed, and ordered a retrial.   

 

]
[
Lord Justice Rix:


This appeal concerns, as its primary ground, a novel and interesting point about the recent provisions governing the admissibility of bad character under the Criminal Justice Act 2003. Following a plea of guilty to manslaughter, are previous convictions of (relatively low level) violence admissible to prove the specific intent of the offence of murder? There is also a second ground of appeal, which concerns the manner in which the judge directed the jury concerning the appellant's lies in interview.

 

The appellant is Lee David Bullen, now 23, who on 17 October 2006 at the Crown Court at Maidstone before HH Judge Patience QC and a jury was convicted of the murder of Drew Shepherd. He was sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum term of 15 years less 253 days spent in custody on remand. He appeals against conviction with the limited leave of the single judge. At the conclusion of the hearing, the appeal was allowed. These are our reasons for allowing the appeal.

 

At the start of the trial, the appellant pleaded guilty to manslaughter, which was added to the indictment as count 2. The issue for the jury, therefore, was simply whether he had intended to kill or cause grievous bodily harm, and thus been guilty of murder. There was no other issue. His defence was lack of specific intent and he relied on his drunkenness. He had hit the deceased in the neck with a broken beer bottle which had penetrated the jugular vein. The appellant did not give evidence, but he had answered questions in interview.

 

The death of Drew Shepherd occurred in a drunken fight early in the morning of 3 February 2006, after an afternoon and evening of socialising. The appellant and his friend John Towers, with their respective girlfriends, had started off in a pub, where they had met the deceased and his girlfriend. The deceased was a friend of John Towers but previously unknown to the appellant. The same group reassembled in Towers' girlfriend's home later that evening, with the addition of another of the deceased's friends, Steve Lapping. The group consumed quantities of alcohol and other drugs. At about 1 am Towers offered the deceased, his girlfriend and Lapping a lift home. The appellant joined them. Lapping was dropped off first and did not witness what was to happen later. He was not aware of any tension in the car. 

 

The fight started after the group had got out of Towers' car close to the deceased's home. There was uncontradicted evidence from Towers that the deceased had struck the first blow; but there was also evidence from the deceased's girlfriend that during the journey the appellant had become cocky and flirtatious and had asked for a kiss. However, the evening as a whole had been friendly, she said. There were loose beer bottles in the footwell of the car, and when the appellant got out of the car he was holding one. 

 

Everyone was more or less drunk. A fight began between the deceased and the appellant. Only Towers saw it start, with two blows from the deceased on the appellant: when the deceased came towards the appellant again, the latter struck him with the bottle in his hand and smashed it against his head. The two men were in the middle of the road, on the ground, hitting one another, the deceased on his knees, on top or leaning over the appellant. Towers hauled the deceased up first, and the appellant then got up. Towers saw blood on both of them. The fight resumed. It moved from the middle of the road to its side, and ended up by a wall on which the deceased sat, generally unresponsive, while the appellant punched him repeatedly as his girlfriend tried to protect him.

 

The forensic evidence suggested that the fatal wound had been inflicted in the middle of the road, at the start of the fight, for that was where most of the broken glass and blood was to be found; but that inference was not common ground. 

 

Apart from Towers and the deceased's girlfriend, the other witnesses of the fight were local residents looking out of their windows, some at least of whom had been woken up from their sleep. None of them saw the start of the fight. No one described the fatal blow.

 

There was evidence of things said by the appellant at various stages of the fight, such as "I've done a number on you", or "You're lucky. I could" (or "should") "have stamped on your head", or "That's what you get when you", or "I could have kicked his head in". The word "stab" was also heard.

 

Towers took the appellant away by car, back to their girlfriends' home. He had not realised how badly injured the deceased had been when they left the scene. 

 

The pathologist certified the cause of death as the most serious of three stab wounds at the neck, the fatal one being 5 cms deep, penetrating the jugular vein. The base of the beer bottle made a precise mechanical fit in the area of the neck wounds, consistent with a jabbing or stabbing with a broken bottle. The pattern of injuries could not have been caused if the bottle had shattered as it went in, or by an unbroken bottle. At least moderate force would have been required. The angle of entry was horizontal at 90 degrees to the neck. Other injuries were consistent with falling over bits of broken glass.      

 

There was also evidence about the intoxication of both the deceased and the appellant. The deceased had an alcohol level of 305 mgs per 100 ml of blood, a level associated with extreme drunkenness in an ordinary social drinker. The back calculation performed on the appellant's blood alcohol content after his arrest demonstrated that at the time of the fight his level would have been 235 mgs per 100 ml. Any figure above 200 would be associated with a significant degree of drunkenness in the normal drinker. 

 

The appellant was found asleep at 0530 that morning and arrested. At interview, the appellant initially denied having a bottle. At a subsequent interview, he accepted having a bottle and using it, saying that he swung it round and hit the side of the deceased's head, in the area of the ear, when it smashed to pieces, leaving nothing in his hands. The prosecution said that these amounted to two lies: the first, that he never had a bottle at all, and the second, that he was never left with a broken bottle in his hand.

 


The ruling on the admission of bad character


At a time when the appellant had not yet accepted manslaughter responsibility for the death of the deceased, the Crown gave notice of intention to adduce bad character evidence pursuant to section 101(1)(d) of the 2003 Act. The notice was served in response to the anticipation that the appellant was claiming that he acted in self-defence. The notice set out the details of 8 previous convictions. One prosecution had in fact failed: ultimately only 7 previous convictions were admitted. The notice asserted that these previous convictions were relevant because they showed "that the defendant has a propensity to be violent" and "to determine whether or not the defendant was acting in lawful self-defence." In three of the previous convictions, the appellant had originally claimed self-defence; in one of the previous 7, a glass had been used and this was also relevant to "whether the defendant was acting in lawful self defence". 

 

The offences for which the appellant had been convicted had occurred between 22 June 2000 and 13 November 2005. He had pleaded guilty on six of the seven occasions. The judge was to sum up these convictions to the jury at length, over the space of two and a half pages of the transcript. There were seven convictions, but one of them involved four offences, so there were in all ten offences. The four earlier appearances were in a youth court, and the three later appearances were in a magistrates' court. The guilty pleas were to: an offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm (a punch to a shop-keeper); an offence of assaulting a police officer in the execution of his duty (kicking and lashing out at police officers and a nurse while in police custody); an offence of using threatening words or behaviour with intent to cause fear of violence (punching a woman at a railway station and threatening to cut a man who intervened on her behalf); an offence of common assault (throwing a piece of wood which hit its target, in the course of a neighbour dispute); another offence of common assault (punching a woman in the face after he had been ejected for drunkenness from a pub and he began kicking the front door and she said she was going to call the police); and a third offence of common assault (punching his 18 year old brother in an argument). The last three offences occurred in 2005, the first three in 2000/2001: the appellant was then aged 15 to 21. He was 22 at the time of his trial for murder. 

 

The four offences to which he pleaded not guilty arose out of a single incident in June 2002: the appellant was swearing in a public place, a lady asked him to stop, he grabbed her by the throat and punched her, her 16 year-old son intervened and was also punched, her husband intervened and was struck over the head with the glass in his hand, which broke. He was convicted of offences of actual bodily harm, two common assaults and affray.

 

The Crown persevered at trial in its application to admit evidence of these previous convictions, even though there was no longer any issue of self-defence, for the appellant had accepted that he was guilty of manslaughter. The Crown continued to submit that these offences demonstrated "a propensity on the part of the appellant to commit acts of violence which therefore made it more likely than might otherwise have been the case that the defendant was guilty of murder". The defence submitted that none of these convictions were for offences of specific intent and showed no more than a tendency to behave violently. The judge ruled in favour of the Crown's application. The judge addressed himself thus to the three questions posed by the Vice-President, Lord Justice Rose, in R v. Hanson [2005] 2 Cr App R 21 at para 7:

 

"One: does the history of convictions establish a propensity to commit offences of the kind charged? In my judgment they did; they were offences of violence, involving, in some cases, the use, or threat of use of weapons, committed sometimes in drink, and all, save in one instance to which I have referred, deliberate acts.

Secondly: did the propensity make it more likely that the defendant committed the offence of murder? In my judgment, it was open to the jury to conclude that they did, after receiving a proper direction, and considering the matter in the appropriate context, and of course, against the background of the whole of the evidence in this case.

Thirdly: is it right to rely on these convictions and will the proceedings be unfair if they are admitted? In my judgment, both questions fell to be answered in the negative; these matters were not so prejudicial or scandalous as to cloud the issue before the jury, or to lead them to an adverse verdict, without a proper consideration of the whole of the evidence."


The judge's directions to the jury


It is not clear from the judge's ruling exactly how he considered that the previous convictions threw relevant light on the issue of specific intent before the jury at trial. However, he acknowledged the need for the jury to receive a proper direction which would assist them to see the evidence of bad character in the appropriate context. It is important, therefore, to see how he did direct the jury with regard to that evidence and the issue of specific intent which was before them.

 

There is no doubt that the judge directed the jury about the issue of intent impeccably. Early in his summing-up he identified it as "the live issuearound his state of mind; what he intended, when he struck Drew Shepherd in the neck with that broken bottle" (at transcript 1, page 11C); and late in his summing-up, after emphasising that the infliction of the fatal blow with the broken bottle was admitted, he spoke of the issue  again, saying "you have got to decidewhy he did it, what was in his mind" (transcript 2, pages 46H/47A).  The judge began by telling the jury that an intent can be maintained for a long time, or formed suddenly, as in bad temper. He then proceeded to assist them as to how they might form a judgment about intent, viz by looking at what the defendant was "saying and doing before, at the time of, and indeed after the act that lead to Drew Shepherd's death". Thus, questions which might occur to the jury to ask themselves, if they found it helpful, might be: What weapon was used? Where the deceased was struck? What the appellant's purpose was in doing as he did? Whether the appellant had proceeded to attack the deceased further when he was sitting on the wall, and, if so, why? What was he heard to say? Finally, he directed the jury in standard terms about the significance of drunkenness to the question of intent. 

 

Nowhere in this direction, which covered four pages of the transcript, did the judge mention the appellant's previous convictions as throwing any possible light on the issue of intent. But a little later in his summing-up, albeit separated from his directions on intent by further directions dealing with the drunkenness or sleepiness of various witnesses and with the significance of the evidence of the forensic experts, the judge turned to "Another matter of law, entirely separate, but very important" (emphasis added), namely the matter of previous convictions. We have already set out above the essence of that evidence of bad character. It is necessary, however, to set out in full the rest of the judge's directions on this subject matter, emphasising certain further parts of them. He said 

 

"Another matter of law, entirely separate, but very important: you may have wondered why it was that you heard evidence of previous convictions recorded against the defendant: in other words, that he has what the lawyers call a bad character, in the sense that he has criminal convictions recorded against him. Members of the jury, I will remind you of what those facts were, so that you have them in mind, if you were not able to follow them, and then give you directions as to how you should approach that evidence because it is very important that you understand why you heard that evidence, and what use you should make of them

Members of the jury, those matters were not put before you in that detail just, as it were, to aggravate the defendant's situation, or make it worse, or still less to prejudice you. That is not the purpose of your hearing that material. It is important, as I have said, that you understand why you have heard this evidence, and how you can use it. It is also highly important that you keep in mind that you must not convict Lee Bullen of murder only because he has this bad character. The evidence of these offences may help you to resolve an issue that has arisen between the Crown on the one hand, and the defence on the other; namely, whether this defendant has a propensity that is to say a tendency, to commit violent offences of the kind with which he is now charged because, of course, murder is a violent offence, like the offences you have heard about in this history. 

If you think it right, you may take the previous convictions into account in deciding whether or not Lee Bullen committed the offence of murder. The Crown relies upon them because the Crown argue that the convictions show that Lee Bullen has a tendency to commit acts of violence, sometimes in drink, sometimes involving either the use of a weapon, or the threat to use a weapon. You have to decide whether these convictions do demonstrate such a tendency  that is for you to decide  and if so, whether or not that tendency makes it more likely that he committed the offence of murder which you are trying. You have to decide, in other words, to what extent, if at all, these convictions help you when considering whether or not he is guilty of murder, and considering at the same time the whole of the evidence put before you in reaching that decision. You must not, I repeat, convict simply because of the convictions, nor indeed mainly because of them. The propensity, or tendency, if you find that there is such, amounts to some additional evidence pointing to guilt, but bear in mind, even if you find that Lee Bullen does have such a tendency, it does not necessarily prove that he would commit further offences, or that he has committed this offence which you are trying"


After the jury retired to consider their verdict, they sent the judge a note, which raised three questions:

 

"(1) Can you give us a copy of the legal definition of murder and manslaughter? (2) Can you clarify intention, serious harm(3) Has he admitted self-defence, or said that it wasn't self-defence?"

The judge discussed this note with counsel and overnight prepared a document for the jury, which was handed to the jury, and which he also read into the transcript. He there emphasised that, having pleaded to manslaughter, the appellant had admitted that he had not been acting in lawful self-defence, and that the issue of self-defence therefore did not arise. As for intention, the judge repeated the essence of the full direction that he had given towards the beginning of his summing-up. As before, that direction said nothing whatsoever about how the evidence of bad character could assist the jury, or be taken into account by them, in coming to their view on that single, critical issue. 

We observe that in his direction on the evidence of bad character, the judge had told the jury that it was a matter "entirely separate"; that it was important for them to understand why they had heard that evidence; that the reason was so that they could consider the Crown's submission that it was evidence of a propensity to violence; and that, if they accepted that submission, such a propensity was additional evidence which pointed to guilt of murder. The judge did not explain how an accepted propensity to violence, of the kind indicated by the previous convictions, assisted the jury on the question of murder, which in the circumstances was entirely a question of specific intent. Nothing the judge said on the two occasions when the judge dealt with the question of intent tied it expressly in any way into the evidence of bad character; and vice versa. 

 

 
The Criminal Justice Act 2003


The relevant provisions of the 2003 Act are as follows:

 

"101.  (1) In criminal proceedings evidence of the defendant's bad character is admissible if, but only if, -
  
(d) it is relevant to an important matter in issue between the defendant and the prosecution

(3) The court must not admit evidence under subsection (1)(d) or (g) if, on an application by the defendant to exclude it, it appears to the court that the admission of the evidence would have such an adverse effect on the fairness of the proceedings that the court ought not to admit it.

103. (1) For the purposes of section 101(1)(d) the matters in issue between the defendant and the prosecution include 
(a) the question whether the defendant has a propensity to commit offences of the kind with which he is charged, except where his having such a propensity makes it no more likely that he is guilty of the offence

(2) Where subsection (1)(a) applies, a defendant's propensity to commit offences of the kind with which he is charged may (without prejudice to any other way of doing so) be established by evidence that he has been convicted of -
(a) an offence of the same description as the one with which he is charged, or
(b) an offence of the same category as the one of which he is charged.
 
(3) Subsection (2) does not apply in the case of a particular defendant if the court is satisfied, by reason of the length of time since the conviction or for any other reason, that it would be unjust for it to apply in his case.

(4) For the purposes of subsection (2) 
(a) two offences are of the same description as each other if the statement of the offence in a written charge or indictment would, in each case, be in the same terms;
(b) two offences are of the same category as each other if they belong to the same category of offences prescribed for the purposes of this section by an order made by the Secretary of State."


The submissions on appeal


On behalf of the appellant, Miss McGowan QC, who had also defended him at trial, submitted that the issue at trial was that of specific intent; that, given the plea to manslaughter, the appellant's propensity to violence was not in issue, and certainly not an important matter in issue; the whole actus reus had been proved by the guilty plea; as for the required mens rea of specific intent, all previous convictions had involved offences of only basic intent, and could throw no light on the issue at trial. As for the judge's summing up, he never explained, throughout his lengthy direction on bad character, how that evidence went to the issue before the jury. Nor, in dealing with the appellant's intention, did he see any need to refer to the appellant's bad character. It was never suggested that the basis of the admission of bad character was to show that the appellant would have appreciated from his past conduct that violence was capable of causing really serious physical harm, thus justifying the inference that he must have intended such harm; and in any event none of the previous offences had caused such harm. Since the previous convictions were irrelevant, they could only be unfairly prejudicial. In terms of the statute: the propensity to violence was not an important matter in issue, or a matter in issue at all (section 101(1)(d) and section 103(1)(a)); the appellant's having such a propensity made it no more likely that he was guilty of murder (the proviso to section 103(1)(a)); it would in any event be unjust to apply the statute's definition of "offences of the kind with which he is charged" (section 103(3)). In any event, such evidence had such an adverse effect on the fairness of the proceedings that the court ought not to admit it (section 101(3) and Police and Criminal Evidence Act, 1984, section 78(1)).

 

On behalf of the Crown, Mr Jonathan Higgs, who had also prosecuted at trial, submitted that the evidence was properly admitted and properly explained to the jury. The bad character was not so much relevant to the "legal ingredient" of specific intent as to various factual sub-issues, such as, Who initiated the violence? And, Why was the appellant armed? Although the evidence was that the deceased had started the fighting, there was also evidence that the appellant had provoked trouble by flirting with the deceased's girlfriend in the car. Indeed, he had no need to have gone along for the ride at all, nor to get out of the car when the deceased was dropped off. As a violent man who had used weapons before, the jury were entitled to consider whether he had deliberately set the incident up. Next, Did the appellant realise the bottle was broken and continue to use it? Did he continue to attack once the deceased had ceased to defend himself, and why? Mr Higgs suggested that the bottle broke initially, even before the area in the middle of the road where most of the blood was found. He also suggested that the fatal blow may only have been sustained at the very end, when the deceased was sitting on the wall, not defending himself. Such sub-issues would inform the jury's consideration of the outstanding legal issue of specific intent. None of those factual issues had been addressed by the appellant's guilty plea to the lesser offence. 

 

Moreover, the judge had correctly applied the three questions of Lord Justice Rose from Hanson in his ruling, and directed the jury in standard terms, leaving it to them to say whether the previous convictions did establish a propensity for violence, and warning them not to convict the appellant only or mainly because of his bad character. Although the judge, in dealing in his summing-up with the question of intention, posed different questions to the jury from those posed in these submissions, and did not refer at all in this context to the appellant's previous convictions, it would have given those convictions undue prominence if he had weaved them into his direction on intent: as it was, it was more helpful to the appellant to deal with his previous convictions entirely separately. As for the statute, section 103(2) and (4), by the width of its language, showed a deliberate intention to allow convictions for previous violent offences of only basic intent to figure in a trial charging a more serious offence of specific intent. There was no unfairness in the admission of the disputed evidence. In sum, a record of sustained violence was relevant.

 


Discussion of ground 1: the admissibility of bad character


We think that the judge here erred in principle in admitting this evidence of bad character, without examining sufficiently further what relevant light it could throw on the issue (or sub-issues) at trial. Matters started to go wrong when the notice of intention to adduce bad character evidence, which had been designed to deal with a case of self-defence to which a propensity for violence was clearly relevant, was not rethought or adapted in the light of the plea to manslaughter. The appellant thereby admitted that his use of violence was unlawful. He did not dispute carrying the bottle or using it when broken, or the cause of death. He did not dispute his intoxication, indeed he relied on it. He accepted that on that occasion at least he had been violent in drink. Only his intent was in issue. The judge correctly identified that issue as the critical, indeed the sole substantive issue, for the jury, and he properly directed them on that.

 

In these circumstances, we do not think that a propensity for violence was relevant to or itself an important issue in the trial, if it could be said to be an issue, or relevant to an issue, in the trial at all. The Crown continued to say that it was an issue, and the judge accepted that submission in his ruling and directed the jury accordingly, for both in his ruling and in his summing-up he ascribed the reason why the evidence of the appellant's bad character had been admitted was because it threw light on a propensity to violence, indeed on a "propensity to commit offences of the kindcharged". But neither in his ruling nor in his summing-up did the judge explain any further what he meant by that, or how the bad character was relevant to an important issue between prosecution and defendant, or what issue he had in mind. 

 

It is true that these provisions of the 2003 Act are intended to replace the common law relating to bad character (see section 99(1)), and that the rules of the common law are not to be brought back by a restrictive interpretation of sections 101(1)(d) and 103: see Spencer, Evidence of Bad Character, 2006 at 62-66. Thus, there is no need for "striking similarity" as in DPP v. P [1991] 2 AC 447: see Hanson at para 10. It may also remain true that a defendant who claims he did not commit an offence (for instance of violence) at all but who admits his propensity to violence, may not succeed thereby in keeping out his previous convictions for violence, which may remain relevant to the question of his guilt, possibly because of the degree or nature of his propensity (see Spenser at para 4.25 at 63). Above all, the statutory language is no doubt intended to underline the significance of the complete change from the basic position of the common law, which was that, save for certain, limited, defined exceptions, previous bad character was not prima facie relevant at all to a defendant's guilt. Nevertheless, for all the change in the law, the test is still relevance: see section 101(1)(d) itself, and the introductory language of section 101 itself  "is admissible if, but only if(d) it is relevant to an important matter in issue". The fact that section 103(1) seems also to have the effect of always potentially including the "question of" propensity among "the matters in issue" should not be overstated to the extent that sight is lost of the need for relevance: the bad character must still be relevant to an "important" issue; it will not be a matter in issue at all where the proviso to section 103(1)(a) operates ("except where his having such a propensity makes it no more likely that he is guilty of the offence"), and the safeguard of section 103(4), where it would be "unjust" for previous convictions of the same description or category to be admitted to be used to establish a propensity, itself emphasises the significance of relevance's handmaiden, probative value. Thus it is contemplated that it could be unjust for section 103(2) to apply "by reason of the length of time since the conviction or for any other reason".  Section 101(3), reflecting the rationale of PACE's section 78, also requires a balancing of probative value and undue prejudice to the defendant.

 

No authority has been cited to us regarding the particular problem before this court. We have, however, been referred to para 371 of the Explanatory Notes to the 2003 Act, concerning the proviso to section 103(1)(a), as follows:

 

"Evidence is not, however, admissible on this basis if the existence of such a propensity makes it no more likely that the defendant is guilty. This might be the case where there is no dispute about the facts of the case and the question is whether those facts constitute the offence (for example, in a homicide case, whether the defendant's actions caused death)."

We can see that causation generally lies wholly in the facts of a particular case, and does not depend on a propensity. However, the statutory language is general, as in principle it is bound to be.

We have observed that in R v. Duggan, reported together with R v. Edwards [2005] EWCA Crim 1813, [2006] 1 Cr App R 3 (31), evidence of a previous conviction for an offence of common assault was relied on amongst others for the purpose of proving an offence of wounding with intent. In that case, however, the defendant claimed he was entirely innocent of any wrongdoing at all, blaming the woman he had injured with a bottle for first bumping into him and then moving her glass to his face as though to attack him, as a result of which he merely brought his arm up in self-defence. This court thought that the previous conviction was highly relevant and capable of establishing "propensity to violence relevant to the crucial issue as to who was the aggressor". In our judgment, that has no bearing upon the present appeal. It merely illustrates how the particular circumstances of a previous offence may show a propensity to violence as shedding light on a particular issue in a later trial. 

 

On the contrary, in R v. Leaver [2006] EWCA 2988 (10 November 2006, noted in Archbold 2008 at para 13-65a) the terms in which a previous conviction, for the offence of indecent exposure with intent to insult a female, were left to the jury at a trial where the defendant was charged with rape and causing grievous bodily harm with intent (section 18) led to a successful appeal. That was a case where the previous conviction had been admitted by agreement. So far as the rape count was concerned, there would have been no difficulty if the judge had limited his directions to the jury to a formula agreed with counsel that the previous conviction was relevant to whether the defendant had a propensity to degrade and insult women for his own gratification. However, the judge had gone further than that in his remarks in suggesting that the jury had heard about the previous conviction also for other, in this court's judgment, irrelevant reasons. In particular, the previous conviction had no relevance at all for the section 18 count, on which the defendant had admitted the assault and only put in issue his intent to cause grievous bodily harm. 

 

In the present case, matters in our judgment started to go wrong when the Crown failed to think out anew why they wanted the previous convictions to go in after the plea to manslaughter. That lack of focus is reflected in the judge's ruling, for in his treatment of Lord Justice Rose's three questions he failed to take properly into account the limited nature of the issue at trial and for that purpose the significant fact that the previous convictions had been for offences where neither a specific intent to cause grievous bodily harm nor any causing of grievous bodily harm had been charged or proved. Thus in answering the first question, "1. Does the history of conviction(s) establish a propensity to commit offences of the kind charged?", the judge focussed only on the fact that the offences were offences of violence, sometimes in drink, and in some cases involving the use or threat of use of weapons. He added that save in one instance the violence was "deliberate", but that, in our judgment, was an unsatisfactory and potentially misleading gloss, if it was intended as such, on the concept of specific intent. Even offences of basic intent must be done deliberately (Archbold 2008 at para 17-39a). Given that the issue was not whether the appellant had committed a violent unlawful act causing death, but whether he had the specific intent necessary to murder, the judge should here (or at least elsewhere) have been reminding himself, even while accepting that the appellant's career had certainly showed a propensity for violence, that "a propensity to commit offences of the kind charged" was a deliberately broad concept, properly designed for the generality of cases, but to be handled with care when the sole issue was specific intent. As for "2. Does that propensity make it more likely that the defendant committed the offence charged?", this was the judge's only real opportunity to consider the question of relevance, since he nowhere asked himself the question whether the appellant having the propensity in question is, or is relevant to, an "important" matter in issue (cf Archbold 2008 at para 13-64). The judge answered that question merely by saying that it was open to the jury to conclude that it did, after receiving a proper direction. In our judgment, the judge should have concluded that the answer was No. At any rate, if it was to be Yes, the judge should have explained what light in particular the previous convictions were capable of throwing on the case with which he was concerned. As for "3. Is it unjust to rely on the conviction(s) of the same description or category; and, in any event, will the proceedings be unfair if they are admitted?", the judge said No, on the ground that the previous convictions were not so prejudicial or scandalous as to cloud the issue before the jury. But, if one gets this far, and it is our view that one does not, it does in our judgment seem unjust or unfair to rely on a raft of previous convictions which are not in themselves suggested to throw any light on the issue of intent before the jury. 

 

In this connection, Mr Higgs submits that the previous convictions were relevant to a number of factual sub-issues, even if not to what he calls the "legal ingredient" of specific intent. However, we can find no sign in the proceedings that the previous convictions were presented or deployed in this light or for this purpose. We think that this is really an attempt after the event to find a function for the bad character evidence which they lacked at trial. If this had been the way in which they were deployed, we would have expected to find support for such an analysis in the judge's ruling and summing-up. 

 

That summing-up again reflects the lack of focus at the time of the ruling. We have already observed that the judge's impeccable directions as to the issue of intention were wholly separate from the evidence of bad character. That remained the case when, following the jury's note, the judge returned to the question of intention. Moreover, in dealing with bad character and asking, for the jury's assistance, "why" they had heard that evidence, the judge told them only that it  

 

"may help you to resolve an issue that has arisen between the Crown on the one hand, and the defence on the other; namely whether this defendant has a propensity, that is to say a tendency, to commit violent offences of the kind with which he is now charged because, of course, murder is a violent offence, like the offences you have heard about in his history". 

That is not, however, the way in which Mr Higgs seeks in this appeal to support the admission of the previous convictions. He does not submit that a general propensity to violence made it more likely that the appellant's admitted unlawful assault was on this occasion committed with the specific intent required for murder, but that it supported the Crown's case on particular aspects of their evidence relating to the appellant's intention. Moreover, it is potentially dangerous for the jury to be told that in the instant case previous offences were "of the kind with which he is now charged", even with the further explanation that murder is a violent offence like the offences they had heard about in his past: for that blurs over the critical difference for the purposes of the law and the issue at trial between offences of basic and of specific intent. The statutory language is of course broad in using the concept of "offences of the kind", to allow the possibility of a wide gateway, potentially narrowed by other considerations. But we think that in this passage, subject to his very proper notes of caution, the judge essentially left the jury without any guidance as to how they were to regard or use the lengthy history of previous offending that they had heard about, even though they were positively told that if they found a propensity to violence it "amounts to some additional evidence pointing to guilt".

We would emphasise that the special difficulty in this case is the combination of the narrow issue of intention at trial with the appellant's merely general history, poor as it was, of violence involving only offences of basic intent which had not resulted in grievous bodily harm. The Crown was unable to run a case that his previous history had illustrated the danger of violence as a cause of really serious injury. We are not saying that a more focussed approach might not have been able to identify an (important) issue to which the appellant's bad character was relevant and probative. In particular, the incidents which formed the subject-matter of his convictions on the one occasion he had pleaded not guilty, which had involved the use of a glass, might possibly in some circumstances have been relevantly and fairly deployed. However, for the reasons we have given above, we conclude that on this occasion the judge erred.

 

In these circumstances, Mr Higgs has explicitly accepted on behalf of the Crown that he does not seek to submit that the appeal should nevertheless be dismissed on the ground that the conviction is in any event safe.

 


Ground 2: the lies direction


It follows that ground 2 could not be dispositive; and Miss McGowan said that she did not submit that it would suffice all by itself. We can therefore deal with it briefly. 

 

It will be recalled that two lies were in question: at interview the appellant had first denied having a bottle at all, and subsequently denied having a broken bottle in his hand. 

 

This ground arises out of the terms of the judge's Lucas direction on lies. He said 

 

"why did he lie? That is an important matter for you to consider for this reason: the fact that a lie is told is not, itself, evidence of guilt. Experience teaches us all, does it not, in whatever may be our walks of life, that people will tell lies for very many different reasons. Let me take another one entirely, someone will lie to cover up for someone else, although the liar is not guilty of anything; he is just protecting someone else. Someone will lie because they are frightened, they say the first thing that comes into their head without thinking, or they panic, or they are actually confused. Members of the jury, if any some such innocent reason in that sense is, or may be the explanation for any lies you find that the defendant has told, then of course they will not help you. 

But if you come to the conclusion that the reason, the only reason, or a significant reason for the defendant telling a lie was to cover up what he had done, namely, deliberately to thrust a broken bottle into the neck of Drew Shepherd, intending at least to cause him really serious harm, then of course the lie would add, would it not, as a matter of common sense, very considerable weight to the case for the Crown? So remember always the two stage approach: am I sure a lie was told by the defendant, and if so, what was the reason? Why did he tell that lie? Is it, or may it be the case that the lie was told for an innocent reason in the sense that I have illustrated to you?"    


The difficulty with that direction, Miss McGowan submits, is that it fails to put before the jury the most realistic of possible explanations for the appellant's lies, other than his own consciousness of guilt on the charge of murder, which was that he knew he was guilty of the assault causing the deceased's death, albeit not of the charge of murder, and that he was therefore trying to distance himself from the death as a whole. Mr Higgs submits, on the other hand, that the lies were told when the appellant knew that the police were investigating not just a death, but a murder, and that, because the appellant gave no evidence himself, the jury had nothing from him as to why he had lied, other than to protect himself from his guilt to murder.

 

In our judgment, Miss McGowan's submission is cogent. Even though the appellant gave no evidence, the possibility inherent in the facts of the case was that the appellant would have wished to distance himself from the death as far as he could: for the very reason that he was, at the very least, guilty of manslaughter, as he came belatedly to accept. This may not have been an "innocent" reason like covering up for someone else, or speaking out of panic, fear or confusion, but it would be a matter for the jury to consider whether it was nevertheless an innocent reason so far as the charge of murder was concerned. We think that the judge should to this extent have assisted the jury with this example, while reminding the jury that they had not heard from the appellant on this question, especially as the jury may well not have appreciated that even a fear of acknowledging a lesser guilt may stand as an "innocent" reason for these purposes.  This is in our judgment an example where a direction tailored to the specific circumstances of the particular case is more valuable than a formulaic repetition of a necessarily standard and general exemplar.

 


Conclusion


It was for these reasons that at the end of the hearing of this appeal we ruled that the appeal be allowed, and ordered a retrial.

LORD JUSTICE HOOPER:  I will ask Mr Justice Underhill to give the judgment of the court.

MR JUSTICE UNDERHILL:
 On 24 August 2007, at the Crown Court at Bournemouth, the appellant, who is aged 29, pleaded guilty to one count of rape (in the form of oral penetration).  On 20 September 2007, he was sentenced by His Honour Judge Beashel to six years' imprisonment (less days spent in custody on remand).  He appeals against sentence with the leave of the single judge.

 

 The facts may be summarised as follows.  The appellant and the complainant had been in a relationship for about seven years.  They had a six-year old son.  Although there had been difficulties in the relationship in the past and the complainant had gone to live at a women's refuge for a while, at the time of the offence they were living together.  On the evening of 5 June 2007 the appellant arrived home drunk.  A row developed because the appellant felt jealous of a male friend of the complainant.  He struck the complainant several times hard on the shoulder and face.  She put up her hand to protect herself and received a blow on the hand which caused significant damage.  He then demanded that she give him oral sex.  She did not want to, but because of the violence which she had just suffered she did so.  After a short while she desisted prior to ejaculation on his part.  He said that in that case she would have to masturbate him with her hands, which she then did.  This short account of the facts, which has been helpfully supplied by Miss Brown for the appellant, has been accepted as accurate by Mr Maitland on behalf of the Crown.

 

 The day following the rape, the complainant left home and told the police what had occurred.  The appellant was arrested.  He made an immediate confession of the essential facts.  He said that he had acted under the influence of drink and that he was ashamed of himself for hitting the complainant, although he said that he had not done so in order to make her have sex with him and had not appreciated that she only did so out of fear.  He pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity.

 

 Not surprisingly, the episode had a serious impact on the complainant.  The physical injury to her hand took several weeks to heal and resulted in a substantial loss of earnings.  In a victim impact statement she said that she continued to feel vulnerable and tearful.  She said:

 

"My self-esteem and confidence wasn't great anyway.  It's now rock bottom as at the time of the crime Kevin hurled verbal abuse at me which has made me feel totally worthless."



 The appellant is a man of previous good character.  He had been in regular employment.  A pre-sentence report recorded that he "assumes total blame for these offences", that he recognised that the complainant felt "pressured by and terrified of him" and that he would have to live with his shame for the rest of his life.  He was assessed as a quiet individual who had acted as he did because he was disinhibited by alcohol.  The author of the report noted:

 

"15.  At no time has this defendant attempted to minimise, deny or shift responsibility for his actions.  He is able to calculate the long-term effects on his victim and has spent time examining his behaviour."



A prison report states that he has shown an interest in addressing his offending behaviour.  He has been referred for assessment for three programmes: the Enhanced Thinking Skills Programme, the Sex Offender Treatment Programme and the Healthy Relationships Programme.

 In his sentencing remarks the judge made it clear that he proposed to give the appellant maximum credit for his early plea of guilty.  He then said:

 

"In your written basis of plea you admit that the oral rape was accompanied by violence in that you struck your victim with your open hand.  You accept causing her injuries and included amongst those injuries was damage to the ligaments of her wrist.  It is of note that you are about 6 ft 2 in; she, your former partner, was 5 ft 3 in.  I take into account in your favour the fact that you have never before been before the courts.  It is to your credit that you accept responsibility for this dreadful offence.]

 Lord Justice Rix:


On 7 February 2007 at the Crown Court at Portsmouth before HH Judge Pearson and a jury the appellant, Roger George Doncaster, was convicted of cheating the public revenue (count 1) and two counts of false accounting (counts 2 and 3). He was sentenced to a total of two years imprisonment. He now appeals against conviction with the limited leave of the single judge. He also renews his application for leave to appeal against conviction in respect of two grounds on which the single judge refused leave.

 

Count 1 (cheating the public revenue) related to the appellant's tax affairs in the ten years between April 1992 and April 2002. During this time he had been making tax returns in respect of his trading as a used car dealer, but the Revenue complained that he had cheated in respect of his income tax, national insurance contributions and VAT liabilities in four ways: by failing to disclose the full extent of his turnover, thereby understating his taxable profit; by falsifying sales invoices to support the false turnover and profit figures submitted; by falsely stating his turnover as being below the limit (£50,000) for compulsory VAT registration for the purpose of evading liability to account for VAT; and by deliberately failing to register for VAT knowing that his turnover exceeded the limits for compulsory VAT registration.

 

Counts 2 and 3 (false accounting) related to statements of assets which he had signed during earlier tax investigations on 13 September 1992 and 13 June 2001 respectively. It was charged that he had dishonestly falsified those statements, being documents required for an accounting purpose, by omitting from them the full extent of his then assets, namely bank and building society balances totalling £37,216.71 in the case of the earlier statement and £125,210 in respect of the latter.  

 

The full extent of the evidence deployed against him, which so far as necessary we will briefly describe below, on the Crown's case allegedly showed that for much of his life, from 1983 onwards when he was 33, the appellant had failed to account for his income tax (and later VAT) liabilities, had failed to disclose his assets, and had lied to the tax authorities. In particular he had falsely failed to disclose his full assets in September 1992 and June 2001. In July 2002 his case was referred by tax inspectors to the Revenue's Special Compliance Office (SCO) and a year later in July 2003 he was arrested. Further investigations and searches before and after his arrest revealed the extent of his trading and cash assets. 

 

The appellant's defence at trial was that, although he had done much of which complaint was made over the years in terms of failing to render tax returns or make full disclosure of his assets, and had done so consciously, and had lied in support of his non-disclosures: nevertheless he had done so honestly, always intending to pay any tax due, and that he had made full and proper disclosure of his motor trading and its profits; that his non-disclosed assets and his life-style had been respectively accumulated and supported by income from property dealings or gifts from his father; and that any non-disclosure of his full assets had been in the honest belief that, if he had made such disclosure, the Revenue would have wrongly but maliciously insisted that he justify those further assets as not having been derived from his motor trading.   

 

The appellant had traded as a second hand car dealer in Croydon from 1978 to 1986 and thereafter on the Isle of Wight from 1987. 

 

There had been in all three separate tax enquiries, in 1983, 1990 and 2000. The first enquiry was started in 1983 by the Croydon tax office for failure to notify the Revenue of chargeability for income tax in relation to the years 1978/79 through to 1982/83. In other words the Revenue was concerned that he had been trading and in receipt of income but had not notified the Revenue that he was doing so and had not filed any tax returns. At the conclusion of that investigation the appellant completed a statement of assets and (save that he disputed that it had ever been signed) a certificate of full disclosure. His tax and national insurance liabilities for the relevant years were assessed at £6,617.93 plus interest, of which the appellant paid only £2,100 on account. 

 

In 1987 the appellant moved to the Isle of Wight and again failed to notify the Revenue of his chargeability to income tax in respect of his motor trading. As a result the second enquiry was started in 1990. This enquiry went back to cover the whole period from 1978 through to 1989, because of the appellant's failure to discharge the whole of his assessed liabilities arising out of the first enquiry. On 13 September 1992 the appellant signed a second statement of assets as at 30 June 1992 (that is the statement which is the subject matter of count 2) and a second certificate of full disclosure. The second statement of assets referred to very modest cash credits in a small number of accounts, of which the only building society account was held at the Woolwich. On the basis of this second statement of assets, as the Revenue alleged, they were willing to proceed with a proposed settlement of tax liabilities up to 5 April 1989 in the sum of £45,000. That included an interest and penalty loading of 60%. 

 

The second enquiry was conducted in the main by a local tax inspector by the name of Barry Davies. In the course of the second enquiry it emerged that:  

 
(i)	At an interview on 17 July 1990 the appellant had been told by Mr Davies that he was concerned at the way the previous enquiry at Croydon had gone: he had promised co-operation but had not kept his side of the bargain and had moved to the Isle of Wight without informing the Revenue; full co-operation and disclosure would be expected and a further statement of assets would be required; the Revenue took a serious view of forms subsequently found to be false.
(ii)	At a further interview on 26 July 1990, the appellant disclosed, but only after being seen to visit a local branch of the Abbey National building society, that he had been there to close an account and withdraw £10,000; and then also disclosed the recent closure of three other building society accounts and withdrawals totalling approximately £20,500. He said he had now disclosed all such accounts. The appellant paid the Revenue £25,000 on account. 
(iii)	In a telephone conversation of 4 March 1991 the appellant revealed that over a decade before he had sold a property in Thornton Heath. In a further telephone conversation on 26 April 1991 the appellant's accountant, Mr Hutchinson, told Mr Davies that that sale occurred in 1980 in the sum of £21,000. Mr Davies said that this had not figured in the first certificate of full disclosure, and he again spoke of the serious view that the Revenue took of false statements of assets and certificates of disclosure. 
(iv)	As a result of this latest disclosure Mr Davies referred the enquiry to the Enquiry Branch (as the SCO was then called) for possible transfer to it of further investigations as a case of serious fraud (which under standing order Guidance was the exclusive responsibility of the Enquiry Branch), but the Enquiry Branch declined transfer. When the appellant and Mr Davies next met on 28 January 1992, Mr Davies spoke to the appellant again of how he had promised co-operation but had told lies and was regarded as still being un-co-operative in not disclosing where he was holding the balance of the funds which he had withdrawn from closed building society accounts in the previous summer.]

 Lord Justice Rix:


On 7 February 2007 at the Crown Court at Portsmouth before HH Judge Pearson and a jury the appellant, Roger George Doncaster, was convicted of cheating the public revenue (count 1) and two counts of false accounting (counts 2 and 3). He was sentenced to a total of two years imprisonment. He now appeals against conviction with the limited leave of the single judge. He also renews his application for leave to appeal against conviction in respect of two grounds on which the single judge refused leave.

 

Count 1 (cheating the public revenue) related to the appellant's tax affairs in the ten years between April 1992 and April 2002. During this time he had been making tax returns in respect of his trading as a used car dealer, but the Revenue complained that he had cheated in respect of his income tax, national insurance contributions and VAT liabilities in four ways: by failing to disclose the full extent of his turnover, thereby understating his taxable profit; by falsifying sales invoices to support the false turnover and profit figures submitted; by falsely stating his turnover as being below the limit (£50,000) for compulsory VAT registration for the purpose of evading liability to account for VAT; and by deliberately failing to register for VAT knowing that his turnover exceeded the limits for compulsory VAT registration.

 

Counts 2 and 3 (false accounting) related to statements of assets which he had signed during earlier tax investigations on 13 September 1992 and 13 June 2001 respectively. It was charged that he had dishonestly falsified those statements, being documents required for an accounting purpose, by omitting from them the full extent of his then assets, namely bank and building society balances totalling £37,216.71 in the case of the earlier statement and £125,210 in respect of the latter.  

 

The full extent of the evidence deployed against him, which so far as necessary we will briefly describe below, on the Crown's case allegedly showed that for much of his life, from 1983 onwards when he was 33, the appellant had failed to account for his income tax (and later VAT) liabilities, had failed to disclose his assets, and had lied to the tax authorities. In particular he had falsely failed to disclose his full assets in September 1992 and June 2001. In July 2002 his case was referred by tax inspectors to the Revenue's Special Compliance Office (SCO) and a year later in July 2003 he was arrested. Further investigations and searches before and after his arrest revealed the extent of his trading and cash assets. 

 

The appellant's defence at trial was that, although he had done much of which complaint was made over the years in terms of failing to render tax returns or make full disclosure of his assets, and had done so consciously, and had lied in support of his non-disclosures: nevertheless he had done so honestly, always intending to pay any tax due, and that he had made full and proper disclosure of his motor trading and its profits; that his non-disclosed assets and his life-style had been respectively accumulated and supported by income from property dealings or gifts from his father; and that any non-disclosure of his full assets had been in the honest belief that, if he had made such disclosure, the Revenue would have wrongly but maliciously insisted that he justify those further assets as not having been derived from his motor trading.   

 

The appellant had traded as a second hand car dealer in Croydon from 1978 to 1986 and thereafter on the Isle of Wight from 1987. 

 

There had been in all three separate tax enquiries, in 1983, 1990 and 2000. The first enquiry was started in 1983 by the Croydon tax office for failure to notify the Revenue of chargeability for income tax in relation to the years 1978/79 through to 1982/83. In other words the Revenue was concerned that he had been trading and in receipt of income but had not notified the Revenue that he was doing so and had not filed any tax returns. At the conclusion of that investigation the appellant completed a statement of assets and (save that he disputed that it had ever been signed) a certificate of full disclosure. His tax and national insurance liabilities for the relevant years were assessed at £6,617.93 plus interest, of which the appellant paid only £2,100 on account. 

 

In 1987 the appellant moved to the Isle of Wight and again failed to notify the Revenue of his chargeability to income tax in respect of his motor trading. As a result the second enquiry was started in 1990. This enquiry went back to cover the whole period from 1978 through to 1989, because of the appellant's failure to discharge the whole of his assessed liabilities arising out of the first enquiry. On 13 September 1992 the appellant signed a second statement of assets as at 30 June 1992 (that is the statement which is the subject matter of count 2) and a second certificate of full disclosure. The second statement of assets referred to very modest cash credits in a small number of accounts, of which the only building society account was held at the Woolwich. On the basis of this second statement of assets, as the Revenue alleged, they were willing to proceed with a proposed settlement of tax liabilities up to 5 April 1989 in the sum of £45,000. That included an interest and penalty loading of 60%. 

 

The second enquiry was conducted in the main by a local tax inspector by the name of Barry Davies. In the course of the second enquiry it emerged that:  

 
(i)	At an interview on 17 July 1990 the appellant had been told by Mr Davies that he was concerned at the way the previous enquiry at Croydon had gone: he had promised co-operation but had not kept his side of the bargain and had moved to the Isle of Wight without informing the Revenue; full co-operation and disclosure would be expected and a further statement of assets would be required; the Revenue took a serious view of forms subsequently found to be false.
(ii)	At a further interview on 26 July 1990, the appellant disclosed, but only after being seen to visit a local branch of the Abbey National building society, that he had been there to close an account and withdraw £10,000; and then also disclosed the recent closure of three other building society accounts and withdrawals totalling approximately £20,500. He said he had now disclosed all such accounts. The appellant paid the Revenue £25,000 on account. 
(iii)	In a telephone conversation of 4 March 1991 the appellant revealed that over a decade before he had sold a property in Thornton Heath. In a further telephone conversation on 26 April 1991 the appellant's accountant, Mr Hutchinson, told Mr Davies that that sale occurred in 1980 in the sum of £21,000. Mr Davies said that this had not figured in the first certificate of full disclosure, and he again spoke of the serious view that the Revenue took of false statements of assets and certificates of disclosure. 
(iv)	As a result of this latest disclosure Mr Davies referred the enquiry to the Enquiry Branch (as the SCO was then called) for possible transfer to it of further investigations as a case of serious fraud (which under standing order Guidance was the exclusive responsibility of the Enquiry Branch), but the Enquiry Branch declined transfer. When the appellant and Mr Davies next met on 28 January 1992, Mr Davies spoke to the appellant again of how he had promised co-operation but had told lies and was regarded as still being un-co-operative in not disclosing where he was holding the balance of the funds which he had withdrawn from closed building society accounts in the previous summer.]
[
MR JUSTICE SAUNDERS:  On 28th September 2007 the three appellants were sentenced to three years' detention under section 91 of the Powers of Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000.  All the appellants were at that time aged 17.  They had previously pleaded guilty on 31st August 2007 to an offence of attempted robbery and an offence of robbery at the plea and case management hearing.  Both the attempted robbery and the robbery formed part of the same events.

 
The robbery was of an Argos store in Croydon.  It took place on 14th July 2007.  At 8.00 am in the morning the manager arrived at the store in order to open it prior to trading taking place.  He was confronted by the three defendants.  Their faces were hidden by hoods and scarves.  It is apparent from what later happened that they were not the only people involved.  There was at least one further person involved in the robbery who was in a car outside who was no doubt to act as the getaway driver and also acted as a lookout to warn the robbers if the police came on the scene.  

 
They grabbed hold of the manager.  They demanded access to the shop and they demanded to be taken to the safe which was in a back office.  They frog-marched the manager by holding him by the collar to the safe.  He was made to jump over the counter of the shop and unlock the cash office.  One of the three men, and it cannot be said which of these three it was, was continually hitting him on the back of the head to make sure he complied with instructions which they were giving him.  It will not surprise anyone to realise that the manager was extremely frightened for his own safety and felt he had no option but to comply with the instructions which were being given to him by these three.

 
Once in the cash office they demanded that he open the safe and give them the money.  As it happens there was a great deal of money in the safe.  The manager was unable to open it because it was governed by a time lock and therefore would not open.  It is only due to the time lock being in operation that these robbers were not able to get away with a very large amount of money.  They took the manager's mobile phone, no doubt to prevent him from calling for assistance.  In fact he had been able to raise the alarm.  

 
Once it became apparent that they could not get into the safe, the appellants demanded access to the CCTV controls - their intention no doubt to remove the tape to remove any evidence of they having been in the shop.  They were unsuccessful in that because it turned out that the CCTV was digital and did not operate on a tape.  As they could not get money, the appellants demanded PlayStations and they took a number, five of them.  It may be that they were articles they would find easy to exchange for ready money and that was the reason why they took them.  

 
They were interrupted in the course of the robbery because the lookout rang them on a phone to tell them that the police were arriving.  They tried to escape but they were caught red-handed.  

 
As we say, all of these appellants are 17 years of age.  All have had some contact with the courts in the past, although for nothing of this seriousness.

 
What were the proper inferences that the judge was entitled to draw from those facts?  He was entitled to draw the inference, in our judgment, that this was a carefully planned robbery.  It would have required surveillance to take place to ascertain when the manager would arrive at the shop.  They must have known before they went there that there was a safe in the premises and they no doubt would not have bothered to carry out the robbery at all had they not been assured, somehow, that money was kept in the safe and a significant amount of money.  They were also fully aware of the CCTV and but for the time lock there is no reason to suppose that these three men with their accomplice outside would not have got clean away from those premises with a large amount of money.  

 
In mitigation defence counsel - and we are grateful for the very clear and helpful submissions that they have made to this court - referred the learned judge to the sentencing guidelines for robbery which were published in July 2006.  By section 172 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, courts must have regard to those guidelines.  It appears from the sentencing remarks that the learned judge on this occasion was not familiar with the way in which these particular guidelines worked.  The robbery guideline does not cover all forms of robbery.  It does not give a guideline for professionally planned commercial robbery, for example, but it does give guideline sentences for 'less sophisticated commercial robberies'.  The very phrase "less sophisticated commercial robberies" raises the issue of less sophisticated than what?  One is only left on the basis of the guidelines with it being less sophisticated than professionally planned commercial robbery.  In the guidelines courts are referred for guidance on professionally planned commercial robberies to such authorities as R v Turner which deal with professionally planned armed robberies where sentences of 15 years are suggested.  

 
On the basis that this case was a less sophisticated commercial robbery, defence counsel argued, and they were perfectly entitled to put this argument, that it came within level 1 - that is robberies where there is a threat of or use of minimal force.  Because these offenders were 17 or under, the appropriate range of sentence as set out in the guideline would be a community order up to 12 months' detention and training order.  Because that is the guideline on a plea of not guilty, counsel, again perfectly properly, submitted to the court that the appropriate sentence would be a community order.  In our judgment, as will be apparent from the facts of the case as we have outlined them, that was in reality a very optimistic one indeed.  

 
Although the judge does appear to have misread the guidelines, he expressed the view that he did not think this could really be properly described as a less sophisticated commercial robbery, but he also did not think that it really came within the same bracket as R v Turner for organised armed robbery and he took the view that it lay somewhere in between.  He was perfectly entitled to take that view.  In the case of Attorney General's Reference Nos 32, 33 and 34 of 2007 [2007] EWCA Crim. 1375, Hughes LJ said this: 

 
"... the boundary between a 'less sophisticated commercial robbery' and 'a professionally planned commercial robbery' is plainly not a hard and fast one.  There will be very many cases which could be regarded properly by the trial judge as falling into either category [or fall into neither category]."  
That of course does not mean that the judge does not still have to have regard to the guidelines.  But where he takes the view that it falls between those two descriptions, he is perfectly entitled to take that into account as a factor which may put it in a higher range of sentence.  Further, the judge is perfectly entitled to consider the aggravating features in the case and in this case there were a number.  There was more than one offender involved - there were in fact four, but three actually at the scene of the robbery itself inside the shop.  The offence was pre-planned and in our judgment not "keystone cops" planning as has been submitted but properly and carefully planned.  The offenders were wearing a disguise.  There was, and the judge accepted, no evidence to support the prosecution that they were wearing Balaclava helmets, but they were wearing hoods and their faces were covered by scarves.  It may be a small distinction for the victim whether the disguise is a Balaclava or a scarf covering the face supported by a hood over the head.  They were targeting large sums of money.  
Again, as is made clear from the guidelines themselves, the guidelines provide that where aggravating features are exceptionally serious the sentence can move up to the next level and if the judge were to put this within the bracket of a less sophisticated commercial robbery, he was perfectly entitled, in our judgment, to regard these factors as sufficiently serious to move it into a higher level.

 
The real choice facing the learned judge at sentence was whether this was a case which could properly be dealt with by way of a detention and training order, or whether it was necessary to impose a sentence of detention under section 91.  The submission has been made to us that this sentence overall was too long, bearing in mind the pleas of guilty and the ages of the appellants.  In our view, bearing in mind the nature of this offence as we have outlined it, it is not possible to say that these sentences were manifestly excessive and although, as we have indicated, the judge did not fully follow what was set out in the guidelines, in the event, the result cannot be properly criticised and accordingly the appeals are dismissed.

LORD JUSTICE HOOPER:  I will ask Mr Justice Silber to give the judgment of the court.

MR JUSTICE SILBER:
 On 20 August 2007, in the Crown Court at Chester, before Mr Recorder Killeen, the appellant, Michael James Flack, pleaded guilty on re-arraignment to a count of being the owner of a dog called 'Star' which had caused injury while dangerously out of control in a public place.  He also pleaded guilty to an offence of being in charge of a dog called 'Snoop' while dangerously out of control in a public place.  On 21 August 2007, a destruction order was made in respect of the dog Star and a contingent destruction order was made in respect of the dog Snoop.  The measures specified in relation to Snoop were that he should be muzzled in public places at all times, he should wear a special collar to keep him under control and be kept on a lead at all times in public.

 

 The appeal is against the order for destruction of Star.  It is brought with the leave of the single judge.  

 

 The facts which give rise to this conviction are these.  During the afternoon of 18 June 2006 a Mr and Mrs Stalker were walking through Ridgway Park in Lymm with their three grandchildren.  At the entrance to the park they noticed that there were two dogs running towards them.  Mr Stalker thought that the dogs were behaving aggressively and he told his wife to take care.  Unfortunately, before she could take evasive action, the dogs attacked her lower left leg.  The smaller of the two dogs bit her leg, ripping her trousers and causing a severe wound which bled profusely.  She cried out in pain.  Mr Stalker shouted at the dogs and they ran off.  

 

 An ambulance was called.  On admission to hospital the wounds suffered by Mrs Stalker were sutured.

 

 On 23 June 2006, the appellant's wife went to the Stalkers' home and accepted that the offending dogs belonged to her.  On 27 June 2006, Mr Stalker went to the home of the appellant and his wife.  He identified Star as the dog responsible for biting his wife. 

 

 The basis upon which the appellant pleaded guilty was that an unknown third party had opened the gate behind which the dogs were secured, thereby allowing them to escape.  

 

 Evidence was called before the Recorder from Dr Candy d'Sa, an Animal Behaviour Consultant, who explained that she had carried out an assessment of the dogs Star and Snoop over a period of two hours.  She concluded that they were both sociable to people, very friendly and very playful with each other.  It was her view that there was no reason to fear them or to worry about their temperament in any way.  The evidence of Dr d'Sa was that the behaviour of the dogs at the time of the incident may have been consistent with heavy play which may seem aggressive.  In her report Dr d'Sa said that Star was a neutered bitch Rottweiler crossed with a German Shepherd dog.  She was used as a therapy dog to visit the elderly in care homes.  This had required rigorous training so far as her temperament was concerned.  Dr d'Sa considered that Star and Snoop were friendly and interactive and that they responded to commands.  The dogs displayed no signs of aggression.  They were two of the most passive and friendly dogs which had been encountered by Dr d'Sa.  She considered that the cause of the attack might possibly have been that the dogs had been anxious on escaping from their garden and that they had reacted with fear to unfamiliar stimuli.  Her view was that their aggression would most likely show itself in a single reflexive bite rather than the attack described.  She described the dogs as being calm in the presence of unfamiliar people and passing cars.  They displayed no predatory or exploratory behaviour.  Her conclusion was that there was no evidence that Star or Snoop were inherently aggressive or dangerous dogs and that Mrs Flack showed that she was a capable and experienced dog owner.

 

 There were eight references before the Recorder in respect of Star.

 

 The Recorder explained, correctly, that the offence involving Star required the destruction of the dog unless he was satisfied that she would not cause a danger to public safety.  He accepted that Dr d'Sa had assessed the dog as not being dangerous, but that assessment was undermined to some extent in his view because the assessment took place over a short space of time and largely in the presence of the dogs' owners.  He considered that the expert had not explained satisfactorily why Star had behaved in the way that she had.  The evidence of the Stalkers was that the dogs ran towards them, fighting and behaving aggressively.  In his view the court could not assume that Star would not constitute a danger to public safety.  Thus the Recorder concluded that the court would fail in its duty if it did not make a destruction order.  In reaching that conclusion he had not overlooked the fact that the appellant and his wife were decent people with a history of caring for dogs.

 

 The grounds of appeal are that Star did not constitute a danger to the public and therefore should be exempted from destruction under section 4(1A)(a) of the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991.  It is also contended that there is a statutory power which should have been exercised to impose stringent conditions upon the appellant in relation to the future behaviour of Star with the sanction of the dog being destroyed if there was non-compliance.

 

 The relevant principles that can be made in respect of a dog whose owner has been convicted under section 3(1) of the 1991 Act of failing to keep a dog under control in a public place are that: 

 

	(1)  The court is empowered under section 4(1) of the 1991 Act to order the destruction of the dog.

	(2)  Nothing in that provision shall require the court to order destruction if the court is satisfied that the dog would not constitute a danger to public safety: section 4(1)(a) of the 1991 Act.

	(3)  The court should ordinarily consider, before ordering immediate destruction, whether to exercise the power under section 4a(4) of the 1991 Act to order that, unless the owner of the dog keeps it under proper control, the dog shall be destroyed ("a suspended order of destruction").

	(4)  A suspended order of destruction under that provision may specify the measures to be taken by the owner for keeping the dog under control whether by muzzling, keeping it on a lead, or excluding it from a specified place or otherwise: see section 4(a)(5) of the 1991 Act.

	(5)  A court should not order destruction if satisfied that the imposition of such a condition would mean the dog would not constitute a danger to public safety.

	(6)  In deciding what order to make, the court must consider all the relevant circumstances which include the dog's history of aggressive behaviour and the owner's history of controlling the dog concerned in order to determine what order should be made.

 In this case the Recorder does not appear to have considered whether to impose a suspended destruction order in relation to Star.  If such an order had been considered, it would have been relevant that, apart from the episode which led to the conviction under appeal, Star had not previously been aggressive.  There was evidence from an Animal Behaviour Consultant to that effect.  Another relevant factor is that the appellant is a man of good character.  The Recorder regarded him as a conscientious dog owner.  He made no order disqualifying him from owning or being in control of dogs.  We are not surprised by that conclusion.  It is clear from the evidence before us that the appellant is a competent and conscientious dog owner.

 

 We of course sympathise with Mrs Stalker for the injuries suffered by her.  We have not overlooked that fact in reaching the conclusion that we can set aside the order for destruction.  Instead we make an order that, unless the appellant keeps Star under proper control, she will be destroyed.  We also impose the same conditions that were imposed in relation to Snoop: (1) Star shall be muzzled in public places at all times; (2) she must wear a special collar to keep her under control; and (3) she must be kept on a lead at all times in public.  To that extent the appeal is allowed.

LORD JUSTICE HOOPER:  I will ask Mr Justice Silber to give the judgment of the court.

MR JUSTICE SILBER:
 On 20 August 2007, in the Crown Court at Chester, before Mr Recorder Killeen, the appellant, Michael James Flack, pleaded guilty on re-arraignment to a count of being the owner of a dog called 'Star' which had caused injury while dangerously out of control in a public place.  He also pleaded guilty to an offence of being in charge of a dog called 'Snoop' while dangerously out of control in a public place.  On 21 August 2007, a destruction order was made in respect of the dog Star and a contingent destruction order was made in respect of the dog Snoop.  The measures specified in relation to Snoop were that he should be muzzled in public places at all times, he should wear a special collar to keep him under control and be kept on a lead at all times in public.

 

 The appeal is against the order for destruction of Star.  It is brought with the leave of the single judge.  

 

 The facts which give rise to this conviction are these.  During the afternoon of 18 June 2006 a Mr and Mrs Stalker were walking through Ridgway Park in Lymm with their three grandchildren.  At the entrance to the park they noticed that there were two dogs running towards them.  Mr Stalker thought that the dogs were behaving aggressively and he told his wife to take care.  Unfortunately, before she could take evasive action, the dogs attacked her lower left leg.  The smaller of the two dogs bit her leg, ripping her trousers and causing a severe wound which bled profusely.  She cried out in pain.  Mr Stalker shouted at the dogs and they ran off.  

 

 An ambulance was called.  On admission to hospital the wounds suffered by Mrs Stalker were sutured.

 

 On 23 June 2006, the appellant's wife went to the Stalkers' home and accepted that the offending dogs belonged to her.  On 27 June 2006, Mr Stalker went to the home of the appellant and his wife.  He identified Star as the dog responsible for biting his wife. 

 

 The basis upon which the appellant pleaded guilty was that an unknown third party had opened the gate behind which the dogs were secured, thereby allowing them to escape.  

 

 Evidence was called before the Recorder from Dr Candy d'Sa, an Animal Behaviour Consultant, who explained that she had carried out an assessment of the dogs Star and Snoop over a period of two hours.  She concluded that they were both sociable to people, very friendly and very playful with each other.  It was her view that there was no reason to fear them or to worry about their temperament in any way.  The evidence of Dr d'Sa was that the behaviour of the dogs at the time of the incident may have been consistent with heavy play which may seem aggressive.  In her report Dr d'Sa said that Star was a neutered bitch Rottweiler crossed with a German Shepherd dog.  She was used as a therapy dog to visit the elderly in care homes.  This had required rigorous training so far as her temperament was concerned.  Dr d'Sa considered that Star and Snoop were friendly and interactive and that they responded to commands.  The dogs displayed no signs of aggression.  They were two of the most passive and friendly dogs which had been encountered by Dr d'Sa.  She considered that the cause of the attack might possibly have been that the dogs had been anxious on escaping from their garden and that they had reacted with fear to unfamiliar stimuli.  Her view was that their aggression would most likely show itself in a single reflexive bite rather than the attack described.  She described the dogs as being calm in the presence of unfamiliar people and passing cars.  They displayed no predatory or exploratory behaviour.  Her conclusion was that there was no evidence that Star or Snoop were inherently aggressive or dangerous dogs and that Mrs Flack showed that she was a capable and experienced dog owner.

 

 There were eight references before the Recorder in respect of Star.

 

 The Recorder explained, correctly, that the offence involving Star required the destruction of the dog unless he was satisfied that she would not cause a danger to public safety.  He accepted that Dr d'Sa had assessed the dog as not being dangerous, but that assessment was undermined to some extent in his view because the assessment took place over a short space of time and largely in the presence of the dogs' owners.  He considered that the expert had not explained satisfactorily why Star had behaved in the way that she had.  The evidence of the Stalkers was that the dogs ran towards them, fighting and behaving aggressively.  In his view the court could not assume that Star would not constitute a danger to public safety.  Thus the Recorder concluded that the court would fail in its duty if it did not make a destruction order.  In reaching that conclusion he had not overlooked the fact that the appellant and his wife were decent people with a history of caring for dogs.

 

 The grounds of appeal are that Star did not constitute a danger to the public and therefore should be exempted from destruction under section 4(1A)(a) of the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991.  It is also contended that there is a statutory power which should have been exercised to impose stringent conditions upon the appellant in relation to the future behaviour of Star with the sanction of the dog being destroyed if there was non-compliance.

 

 The relevant principles that can be made in respect of a dog whose owner has been convicted under section 3(1) of the 1991 Act of failing to keep a dog under control in a public place are that: 

 

	(1)  The court is empowered under section 4(1) of the 1991 Act to order the destruction of the dog.

	(2)  Nothing in that provision shall require the court to order destruction if the court is satisfied that the dog would not constitute a danger to public safety: section 4(1)(a) of the 1991 Act.

	(3)  The court should ordinarily consider, before ordering immediate destruction, whether to exercise the power under section 4a(4) of the 1991 Act to order that, unless the owner of the dog keeps it under proper control, the dog shall be destroyed ("a suspended order of destruction").

	(4)  A suspended order of destruction under that provision may specify the measures to be taken by the owner for keeping the dog under control whether by muzzling, keeping it on a lead, or excluding it from a specified place or otherwise: see section 4(a)(5) of the 1991 Act.

	(5)  A court should not order destruction if satisfied that the imposition of such a condition would mean the dog would not constitute a danger to public safety.

	(6)  In deciding what order to make, the court must consider all the relevant circumstances which include the dog's history of aggressive behaviour and the owner's history of controlling the dog concerned in order to determine what order should be made.

 In this case the Recorder does not appear to have considered whether to impose a suspended destruction order in relation to Star.  If such an order had been considered, it would have been relevant that, apart from the episode which led to the conviction under appeal, Star had not previously been aggressive.  There was evidence from an Animal Behaviour Consultant to that effect.  Another relevant factor is that the appellant is a man of good character.  The Recorder regarded him as a conscientious dog owner.  He made no order disqualifying him from owning or being in control of dogs.  We are not surprised by that conclusion.  It is clear from the evidence before us that the appellant is a competent and conscientious dog owner.

 

 We of course sympathise with Mrs Stalker for the injuries suffered by her.  We have not overlooked that fact in reaching the conclusion that we can set aside the order for destruction.  Instead we make an order that, unless the appellant keeps Star under proper control, she will be destroyed.  We also impose the same conditions that were imposed in relation to Snoop: (1) Star shall be muzzled in public places at all times; (2) she must wear a special collar to keep her under control; and (3) she must be kept on a lead at all times in public.  To that extent the appeal is allowed.

[
MR JUSTICE SAUNDERS:  On 4th May 2007 at the Central Criminal Court, this appellant was convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to imprisonment for public protection.  The appropriate determinate sentence decided by the judge was one of seven years, so the period to be spent in custody before the appellant become eligible to apply for parole was three-and-a-half years, less the period already spent in custody.  He appeals against that sentence by leave of the single judge.

 
The killing occurred on 18th February 2006 at the house of the deceased, a man called Johnson.  The appellant knew the deceased somewhat and had gone to his house that night to return a coat that he had borrowed.  The appellant remained at the house for some time with the deceased and another man.  Some drink was consumed but the appellant's case was that he was not drunk.  

 
Shortly after 1 o'clock in the morning the appellant decided to leave and a taxi was called.  The arrangement made with the taxi driver was that the taxi would take the appellant to Bromley.  The taxi driver also agreed to get some cigarettes for Mr Johnson and then take them back to him.  Mr Johnson gave the taxi driver £50 for this purpose.  According to the appellant, Mr Johnson also lent him and let him use his credit card to withdraw some cash which he needed from a cash machine -- cash which was presumably to be a loan from Mr Johnson.  In the event the appellant did not go to Bromley but tragically, as it turned out, returned to Mr Johnson's house because he had entered the wrong PIN number in the cash machine which had therefore kept the card.  

 
What exactly then went on at the house is not clear, but there was an argument and during the course of that argument the appellant stabbed Mr Johnson to death with a kitchen knife which was in Mr Johnson's house.  There were only the two of them present at the time of the killing, that was the appellant and Mr Johnson.

 
The appellant's account was that when he was about to go and when Mr Johnson was accusing him of short changing him, Mr Johnson had attacked him (the appellant) with a knife.  The appellant indeed had a cut to his right hand which was consistent with being a defensive injury and supported his suggestion that it was Mr Johnson who had started the attack.  However, the appellant said that he lashed out at Mr Johnson causing him to drop the knife.  The appellant then picked the knife up and used it to stab Mr Johnson, probably first in the back causing minor damage to the lung, but then stabbed him in the eye, the knife may well have come in and out more than once in the course of that stab.  The blow to the eye was said by the pathologist to be delivered with severe force because it penetrated the skull and went into the brain.  The handle of the knife actually broke off leaving the blade protruding from the eye socket.  The point was made in the course of the evidence by the defence to the pathologist, and was accepted by him, that part of the severity of the force needed could have been caused by Mr Johnson actually coming on to the knife as the blow was struck.

 
At trial the appellant faced a single count of murder.  After discussion with counsel (before speeches) it was decided that the judge would also leave manslaughter to the jury as an alternative on two possible bases, namely lack of intent and provocation.  

 
On the third day of their retirement the jury indicated to the judge by a note that they were unable to agree on murder but had reached a verdict on manslaughter.  This scenario raises considerable difficulties for judges, but by agreement with counsel a second count of manslaughter was added at that stage to the indictment.  The jury were discharged from giving a verdict on murder and they returned a verdict of guilty on manslaughter.  The jury were not asked to return a special verdict, nor are we suggesting they should have been, indicating the basis on which they returned their verdicts of manslaughter.

 
The judge considered it necessary as part of the sentencing process to decide on what basis he should sentence for manslaughter.  Whether in the event it would have made any difference may be uncertain.  Miss O'Neill submitted to the learned judge that he should sentence on the basis that the necessary intent had not been proved.  She argued this way, that as the jury were agreed on manslaughter they could not all have agreed on provocation because inevitably, had that been the case, that would necessarily involve their agreement on the murder charge as well.  If, however, they had all agreed that this was an unlawful killing but were split over whether the necessary intent was proved, then that would explain their unanimous verdict on manslaughter and their failure to agree on murder.  The prosecution however submitted to the learned judge that the judge should make up his own mind on the basis of the verdict of manslaughter because Miss O'Neill's analysis of the jury's verdict on manslaughter and lack of agreement on murder was not the only possible explanation.  It may have been, the prosecution pointed out, and it seems Miss O'Neill conceded in front of the learned judge, that some of the jurors might have found manslaughter by reason of provocation, others on the basis of lack of intent, and some were not agreed that intent had been proved.  The learned judge accepted the prosecution's submissions.  The judge made up his own mind that he should sentence on the basis of provocation.  The judge was satisfied on the evidence that the appellant had clearly demonstrated an intention at least to cause really serious bodily harm by stabbing Mr Johnson in the eye.  

 
We are satisfied that the judge was perfectly entitled to do what he did and reach the conclusion that he did.  We accept that if there is only one possible interpretation of a jury's verdict then the learned judge must faithfully sentence on that basis, whether he agrees with it or not.  But we do not accept that in this case there was only one possible interpretation of the verdict that the jury brought in, ie their failure to agree on murder but their agreement on the manslaughter verdict.

 
In those circumstances, where there is more than one possible interpretation the judge is perfectly entitled, indeed must make up his own mind, on which basis he should sentence and decide that on his view of the evidence.  We do also take the view, which we canvassed during argument, that in this case it is likely to have made little if any difference to the decision that the judge had to make and with which we have to deal, ie the decision to impose a sentence of imprisonment for public protection.  Miss O'Neill accepts that the notional determinate sentence of seven years taken by the learned judge was appropriate on either basis ie provocation or unlawful act manslaughter.  But she argues that the judge would have been less likely to have passed a sentence of imprisonment for public protection on the basis of lack of intent than he would have been on the basis of provocation.  With respect we do not agree.  Indeed arguably it may be a stronger indicator of dangerousness if the judge had sentenced on the basis that the appellant had caused these injuries in the way he did, but at the time he had no intention to cause grievous bodily harm.  That may well support a suggestion that he was dangerous because he lacked insight into the consequences of his own actions.

 
Coming then to the learned judge's decision to pass a sentence of imprisonment for public protection and whether that can be properly criticised before this court.  Manslaughter is a serious specified offence by virtue of section 224 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003.  Therefore the judge was bound to consider the question of dangerousness and, if the learned judge decided that there was a significant risk to members of the public of serious harm occasioned by him of further specified offences, then he was bound by section 225 to pass a sentence of either imprisonment for public protection or life imprisonment. 

 
Further, in April 2005 the appellant had been convicted of racially aggravated threatening behaviour and given a community rehabilitation order.  That offence is a specified offence under the Criminal Justice Act 2003 and therefore by virtue of section 229 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 the judge must assume that there is such a risk unless, when having considered all the information about the offender, the judge considers it would be unreasonable to conclude that there was such a risk.  As has been pointed out by this court in the case of Lang, that it is not by any means automatic that when there is a previous specified offence the judge must reach the conclusion that the offender is dangerous.  But as is also made perfectly clear in the case of Johnson, the Act does require the judge to follow this process and to assume that there would be such a risk unless it was unreasonable to conclude that there was one.  

 
Clear guidance, as we have said, has been given to judges in the cases of Lang and Johnson, as to how they should approach those provisions and it is clear that the judge was well aware of that guidance and applied it, the cases indeed having been referred to during the course of the sentencing process.

 
One of the matters which the learned judge took into account, as you would expect, was the contents of the pre-sentence report and the assessment of risk made by a probation officer.  It is unlikely that any judge would sentence without having the benefit of such a report and such an assessment.  However, it is the way that assessment was carried out which forms another basis of the criticism made by Miss O'Neill of this sentence.  In making the assessment the author of the report used two separate risk assessment tools.  The OASys risk assessment tool which is commonly used by the probation service and also one called the Thornton Risk Matrix 2000, another assessment tool developed by the Home Office.  

 
In the first report which was produced it appeared that the probation officer made her risk assessment on the basis of the Risk Matrix 2000 risk assessment tool only.  That report was withdrawn by the probation officers at the Central Criminal Court and a new report was prepared which made use not only of Risk Matrix 2000 but also OASys.  

 
The probation officer assessed that the appellant posed a high risk of harm and a high risk of causing harm of serious injury.  She concluded that the risk was posed to members of the public and known adults and that the nature of the risk is that the appellant would physically assault members of the public leading to injury or death.  At Part 4 of her report the probation officer made clear the matters she had taken into account.  She said this:  

 
"In assessing risk of harm I have taken into account the nature and circumstances of the current offence, the nature and circumstances of the previous offending behaviour, the escalation in the seriousness of the defendant's behaviour, and the fact that the current offence was committed whilst [he] was wanted on warrant for breach of a community order.  I have also taken into consideration the judge's remarks that provocation contributed to the defendant's behaviour, and the fact that the defendant appears to be remorseful for the offence.  Given all of the above it is my assessment that the defendant poses a high risk of harm.  Mr Griffin should focus on the appropriate offending behaviour work as outlined in the supervision plan in order to lower this risk.  
The risk is posed to members of the public and known adults.  The nature of the risk is that the defendant will physically assault them leading to injury or death.  The risk is likely to be higher in the community than it is in custody.  Risk is not assessed as being imminent.  Circumstances likely to increase risk are alcohol consumption, Mr Griffin fearing for his safely (whether that fear is justified or not), an ongoing dispute between Mr Griffin and a known adult, and the presence of a weapon." 
She then goes on to detail factors which could decrease that risk.  
It is obviously important that the learned judge should be able to see the matters which inform the probation officer's opinion and her conclusion because it is, as has been said more than once, he who has to make the decision making use of course of all the information which is put before him.  

 
In addition to that, in assessing what score or what importance to attach to individual factors, the probation officer used the Risk Matrix 2000 risk assessment tool.  Miss O'Neill has criticised the use of it.  It is right to say that it is a risk assessment tool which is developed primarily to help assess risk when dealing with sex offenders.  But in the introduction it does go on to say 'that it has also been tested with adult males serving a prison sentence following conviction of an offence of non-sexual violence and with a heterogenous group of prisoners who are participating in cognitive skills programmes.  It is therefore reasonable to use it with adult males who have been sentenced for serious non-sexual violence'.  

 
So it is, on the basis of that introduction at least, appropriate to use it, perhaps along with the OASys risk assessment tool as well, in considering these sort of cases.  The use of risk assessment tools by the probation service is clearly necessary for them because risk assessment is an extremely difficult task and the use has been approved by this court in R v Boswell [2007] Crim EWCA 1587.  There was no evidence placed before the judge in this case, as opposed to criticisms made by counsel, to justify the claim that the probation officer had made inappropriate use of the Risk Matrix 2000 system.  The learned judge had in mind the criticisms made by Miss O'Neill of that particular risk assessment tool and he heard from her the dangers of the use of it.  In any event, it is perfectly clear that the learned judge made his own assessment, as is required by statute, no doubt making use of the contents of the report but attaching such weight to them as he thought fit in the light of the criticisms that were made, but it is, as required by statute, he that had to make the assessment.

 
In his sentencing remarks, at page 6A, having set out the basis on which he was going to sentence, he said this:

 
"Because of the nature of the offence you have committed, I have to consider whether it is necessary to pass a sentence of imprisonment for public protection.  If I decide there is a significant risk to members of the public of serious harm caused by you committing further specified offences, I must pass such a sentence.  Because you have previously been convicted of a specified offence, I must assume there is that risk unless it is unreasonable for me to do so.  I have considered the nature of this offence, indeed all the circumstances relating to the offence, your past history which shows an escalating pattern of violence, albeit on a much lesser scale, and indeed the conclusion in the pre-sentence report, which state that you pose a high risk of harm to members of the public and known adults.  It is stated that the nature of the risk is that you will physically assault others, leading to injury or death from offences of violence.  
I accept that I am not bound by that assessment, and I have listened with care to the criticisms your counsel have leveled at that assessment; in particular that it is simplistic in the extreme and makes assumptions without looking at the good features in respect of your personality and conduct.  However, when taken together with these other matters, it seems to me you do pose a significant risk to members of the public of serious harm.  In those circumstances I must pass a sentence for public protection."
We have listened with great care to the criticism made of the learned judge's assessment, but in our judgment, on proper analysis, his findings are unassailable.  Not only did he have all the relevant factors in mind but he had the great benefit which we do not have of observing this appellant during his trial and hearing him give his evidence.  He clearly applied the correct test.  He took into account the Court of Appeal authorities to guide him, and he reached his conclusion, on perfectly proper factors, in our judgment, that the appellant was indeed dangerous and accordingly the sentence of imprisonment for public protection had to be passed, if not a life sentence.  

 
In those circumstances we do not feel it is appropriate for this court to interfere and accordingly the appeal against sentence is dismissed. 

 
MISS O'NEILL:  My Lord, may I mention one matter?  Forgive me for doing so.  I mention Mr Walsh being here with me as my junior.  He was of enormous assistance to me both during the trial and in the preparation of this appeal.  The representation order is for me alone today.  I invited the Registrar to extend it to include Mr Walsh.  That was declined but we were told that we could renew the application before my Lord.  I hope my Lord does not think it an impertinence if I do so.

 
LORD JUSTICE TUCKEY:  Of course it is not an impertinence to ask.  We were even warned that you would. 

 
MISS O'NEILL:  He has been of very considerable assistance to me, my Lord.  It is an unusual case as far as the risk assessment and the Thornton Matrix 2000 matters was concerned, which is where he has been of particular assistance to me.

 
LORD JUSTICE TUCKEY:  No doubt he has been of assistance to you.  (Pause)  I am sorry, Miss O'Neill, we think it might set a precedent.  As you understand normally it is for one counsel and exceptionally leading counsel on an appeal against sentence and much though we appreciate the fact that you have had that assistance we do not think we can extend the representation order.

	MR JUSTICE PITCHFORD:  This is an appeal against sentence with the leave of the single judge.  The appellant was convicted after a trial of six sexual offences against the same 15 year old child, whom we shall call "B".  On 23rd August 2007 he was sentenced by the trial judge, His Honour Judge Lawler QC, at Sheffield Crown Court as follows: count 1, attempted rape, eight years' imprisonment; count 2, rape contrary to section 1 of the Sexual Offences Act 2003, ten years' imprisonment; counts 3 and 4, sexual activity with a child contrary to section 9, seven years' imprisonment; counts 5 and 6, also sexual activity with a child, two years' imprisonment.  All those sentences were ordered to run concurrently, making ten years in all.  The appellant was in addition made the subject of a Sexual Offences Prevention Order and was disqualified from working with children.

 
	B was an immature 15 year old in the care of the local authority when she was befriended by the appellant, who claimed to be aged 23 but looked older.  B was regarded by her carers as naive and sexually vulnerable.  The appellant was introduced to B by her former boyfriend.  Both men were members of the Iraqi Kurd community in Sheffield.  The relationship between B and the appellant, such as it was, lasted for a period of some seven months.

 
	The first offence of attempted rape was committed at the flat at which the appellant was living.  He plied B with vodka until she become senseless.  She woke some hours later on the appellant's bed.  The appellant had removed her trousers and attempted forcible penetration of her vagina.  She resisted him and his response was to punch her two or three times.  

 
	Notwithstanding this incident, the relationship between them continued and they developed a consensual sexual relationship.  Counts 5 and 6 reflected the unlawfulness of that relationship by reason of B's age.   

 
	The appellant was persistent in his demands of B for anal intercourse.  Eventually she agreed.  She agreed on condition that when requested he would stop.  During the act of intercourse B asked the appellant to stop because she was in severe pain.  He did not.  She bit his arms.  He took no notice of her protests and continued to ejaculation.  The appellant was charged and convicted of count 2, rape (anal rape).  Counts 3 and 4 represented further specimen acts of consensual but unlawful anal intercourse which B estimated took place on some 12 occasions.

 
	B's absences from the children's home were noticed.  She was frank with her carers about the relationship and the police were informed.  The appellant denied any sexual familiarity with B and he was eventually disbelieved by the jury.  

 
	The judge, in sentencing, remarked that B was a reluctant witness.  She believed that she was loved by the appellant, but the truth was she was used by him for sexual gratification.  There was a significant age gap between them.  The appellant was fully aware of her age.  He knew that she was naive, immature and vulnerable and took advantage of her.  He gave her small gifts but withdrew them if displeased with her.  The relationship was exploitative, coercive and possessive.  It was plain to the judge that B was in fear when giving evidence, and in his view had shown some courage in going through with her evidence.  She and others like her needed protection.

 
	Mr Batiste has argued that the appropriate starting point for the offence of rape is eight years, conceding that the victim was young and vulnerable.  This is the effect of the guidance of the court in Millberry and others [2003] 1 Cr App R 25, [2002] EWCA Crim 2891 and Corran and others [2005] 2 Cr App R (S) 73, [2005] EWCA Crim 192.  He conceded that the judge was entitled, when reaching the overall sentence, to reflect the course of sexual offending and the presence of violence in count 1.  In mitigation, he relied primarily upon the appellant's previous good character, the fact of consensual sexual activity of a similar kind within a relationship and the absence in the complainant of explicit signs of trauma.  Mr Batiste submits that a sentence of ten years' imprisonment in total was too long.

 
	It is our view that the judge, having presided over the trial, was best placed to make an assessment of the nature and seriousness of the appellant's offending.  Having considered the material before the judge, we do not think that his assessment can be criticised.  

 
	In April of 2007 the Sentencing Guidelines Council issued its guideline on the Sexual Offences Act.  We agree that the starting point for a single act of rape of a child under 16 is about eight years.  The range within which the sentence is likely to fall will be six to 11 years after a trial.  

 
	Here the appellant was guilty of a prolonged period of sexual offending against a vulnerable girl.  It involved violence, grooming and persistence.  It is true that the most serious offence of rape took place in the context of similar consensual activity, but it is also true that the appellant had committed a previous offence of attempted rape against her and continued his sexual exploitation of her unabated for several months.  

 
	In the circumstances we are unable to agree that a sentence of ten years' imprisonment was manifestly excessive in total.  We do agree that there would appear to be a wide disparity between sentences of two years upon counts 5 and 6 and seven years on counts 3 and 4, but since we do not consider the total sentence to be manifestly excessive we do not propose to interfere.  The appeal is therefore dismissed.

This is the effect of the guidance of the court in Millberry and others [2003] 1 Cr App R 25, [2002] EWCA Crim 2891 and Corran and others [2005] 2 Cr App R (S) 73, [2005] EWCA Crim 192.  He conceded that the judge was entitled, when reaching the overall sentence, to reflect the course of sexual offending and the presence of violence in count 1.  In mitigation, he relied primarily upon the appellant's previous good character, the fact of consensual sexual activity of a similar kind within a relationship and the absence in the complainant of explicit signs of trauma.  Mr Batiste submits that a sentence of ten years' imprisonment in total was too long.

 
	It is our view that the judge, having presided over the trial, was best placed to make an assessment of the nature and seriousness of the appellant's offending.  Having considered the material before the judge, we do not think that his assessment can be criticised.  

 
	In April of 2007 the Sentencing Guidelines Council issued its guideline on the Sexual Offences Act.  We agree that the starting point for a single act of rape of a child under 16 is about eight years.  The range within which the sentence is likely to fall will be six to 11 years after a trial.  

 
	Here the appellant was guilty of a prolonged period of sexual offending against a vulnerable girl.  It involved violence, grooming and persistence.  It is true that the most serious offence of rape took place in the context of similar consensual activity, but it is also true that the appellant had committed a previous offence of attempted rape against her and continued his sexual exploitation of her unabated for several months.  

 
	In the circumstances we are unable to agree that a sentence of ten years' imprisonment was manifestly excessive in total.  We do agree that there would appear to be a wide disparity between sentences of two years upon counts 5 and 6 and seven years on counts 3 and 4, but since we do not consider the total sentence to be manifestly excessive we do not propose to interfere.  The appeal is therefore dismissed.

MR JUSTICE BURTON:  The appellant, Mr Paul Leonard Healey, who is 48 years of age, pleaded guilty on 22nd August 2007 at the Crown Court at Leeds to one count of exposure and, on 17th October 2007, he was sentenced by HHJ Taylor to an extended sentence of two years pursuant to section 227 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, consisting of a custodial term of 12 months' imprisonment and an extension period, that is an extended period of licence, of 12 months, with 148 days on remand to count towards sentence.  

 
The appeal for which the appellant has been given leave by the Single Judge relates only to the imposition of the extended sentence, that is that after serving the 12 months' imprisonment he will be at risk of recall under licence and/or will have the benefit of supervision under licence, that is from the positive and negative point of view, for a further 12 months.  Section 227 of the Act is only available, but becomes automatically available, if there is a conclusion by the sentencing judge that there is a risk of serious harm as a result of the commission of further offences by an appellant who has been convicted of, or pleaded guilty to, a specified offence.  Exposure is such a specified offence.

 
The significant context of this case is that the appellant has a considerable record of previous convictions for this very offence.  He has a total of 15 previous convictions on ten different occasions but the relevant offences relate to exposure.  He has nine previous convictions for exposure.  Some of those occurred in a period which was a very long time ago at the beginning of the 1980s but, in the period 2005 and 2006, he has been involved, as a result of which convictions have followed, in a number, a continuing number, of similar matters all relating to exposure.  On 21st December 2005, he was sentenced in respect of three offences of exposure to a total period of imprisonment of nine months, and a Sexual Offences Prevention Order prohibiting him from remaining within 250 yards of a school for the duration of ten years was imposed on him.  All these three offences were committed whilst he was on bail in respect of another matter.  He served those sentences of imprisonment, or at any rate that part of it which he was required to serve, and it would seem that, almost immediately after his release from imprisonment, he was in the same trouble again and he was sentenced on 21st July 2006 at St Albans Crown Court for a further sentence of exposure for which he was given a period of imprisonment of 12 months.  That was the fourth such offence in a relatively short period and this matter, with which we are now dealing and with which HHJ Taylor dealt below, is the fifth such offence and this was committed whilst he was on licence in respect of the fourth.

 
The facts are that, on the evening of 11th March 2007, he was on a train travelling to Leeds when he opened his trousers, exposed his penis and began to masturbate in front of one of the lady witnesses.  Another woman sitting next to her also saw this and both concluded that the conduct of the appellant was being directed at them.  They were both shocked and disturbed.  They moved to other seats facing in the opposite direction but they were still able to see in the reflection of the window what the appellant was doing and he masturbated for about five minutes. They were sufficiently shocked and upset to inform a guard when they got off the train and the appellant was arrested.

 
When interviewed, the appellant said that he had been feeling depressed and had taken a considerable amount of alcohol and 50 Paracetamol tablets, with the implication that this was an unsuccessful attempt to take his own life.  He had, he said, significantly, no recollection of what took place on the train.  He pleaded guilty, as we have indicated, and the learned judge in sentencing had the benefit of reading a pre-sentence report.  There was no psychiatric option being offered to the learned judge.  That pre-sentence report was a very full one and in many ways a very sensitive one.  It referred to the previous convictions and explained the background to the three counts of exposure which had led to the first sentence of imprisonment, which were, it seems, committed in the sight of children, two of them occurring outside a school where they were witnessed by seven teenage girls and the other witnessed by two teenage girls of 13 and 15, two shop assistants and a mother with her young daughter.  

 
The probation officer records that, when questioned in relation to his past offences, he either could not remember them or stated that they were pinned on him and he had not done them.  The probation officer, not surprisingly, indicated that it was concerning that the appellant continued to offend in similar ways and claimed to have no knowledge of the offences.  The probation officer also recorded that he did not view any psychiatric problems to be severe but that it was the appellant who viewed them be severe.  The assessment of the probation officer was that the appellant posed a high risk of harm to the public and to children, that his risk of reoffending was high, that it was concerning that he imported no knowledge of committing the offences and, as the probation officer said: 

 
"If Mr Healey does not accept his behaviour, then it is unlikely that he will be able to address it and change the triggers that result in him offending. 
It is clear that Mr Healey's behaviour deteriorates when he consumes alcohol to excess, and although he states he intends to control his consumption upon release, I have witnessed how quickly he returns to excessive consumption when in the community."  
The recommendation by the officer was that the learned judge should consider imposing an extended sentence.  He noted that he did not consider that Mr Healey would be able to cope with the demands of a community order, that upon release Mr Healey was likely to return to alcohol misuse and that in order to manage his risk in the community time was needed to arrange hostel and supported housing accommodation, mental health care and alcohol misuse services, without which he would be at risk of offending.  He suggested a period of extended licence would be aimed at addressing the risk posed by the appellant and would benefit the appellant by addressing his accommodation issues, allowing him the opportunity to rebuild his life and settle himself and develop long term goals.  

 
Of course, the recommendation by the probation officer was a matter that could only arise if there was jurisdiction to impose an extended licence, and the views of the probation officer as to the high risk of harm, helpful as they always are when set out in a professional report, could not be determinative; the decision was one for the learned judge in the light of all the evidence.  The evidence he had included, of course, that pre-sentence report and, in particular in this case, the previous convictions and the circumstances of the instant offence, including the fact that the appellant was unable to give any account for it.  The learned judged concluded that the appellant posed a significant risk of serious harm to the public and he imposed the extended sentence in accordance with the proposal in the pre-sentence report, having considered the psychiatric report which was before him.

 
The basis of the appeal brought by Mr Jacobs on the appellant's behalf, for which we have indicated leave was given, was, although a number of grounds are set out in the grounds of appeal, that the learned judge erred in concluding that there was a risk of serious harm.  Mr Jacobs has referred us to a number of authorities primarily arising or built round the seminal decision of R v Lang [2006] 2 Cr.App.R(S) 3, [2005] EWCA Crim 2864, and a number of other examples of decisions by this court, to which, of course, must be added the further authoritative decision of this court of R v Johnson and Ors [2006] EWCA Crim 2486.  

 
It is from those authorities capable of being determined: (1) that there must be not only a high risk of harm or a risk of harm but that there must be a risk of serious harm; (2) that the fact that such harm has not happened in the instant offence or in the past does not mean that there is not a risk of it for the future; (3) that the fact that there is a Sexual Offences Prevention Order in place may be a relevant factor in considering whether there is a continuing risk: (4) that the learned sentencing judge is the judge who must make up his mind in the light of the evidence and upon the evidence and, quoting Johnson at paragraph 11(i), per the President of the Queen's Bench Division: 

 
"... where the sentencer has applied the statutory assumption, to succeed the appellant should demonstrate that it was unreasonable not to disapply it."
In those circumstances, Mr Jacobs seeks to show us that the learned judge was unreasonable in concluding here that there was a risk of serious harm.  It is noteworthy, of course, that this offence itself, one of exposure, is a specified offence and therefore it cannot be said, even if it were on the basis of Mr Jacobs' argument supportable, that exposure is not such a serious offence as can lead to serious harm.  There must be and will therefore be cases in which such a statutory assumption will apply and the learned judge plainly thought that this was such a case, and hence his conclusion.  
It is plainly the case that this kind of offence can cause serious psychological harm.  It is right, as Mr Jacobs points out, that there was no evidence that the two ladies who were the witnesses of this particular offence did suffer any such harm, although they were both shocked and distressed.  But the past history of this appellant shows that, as the probation officer recognised, his offending has not been limited to adults who may or may not have the strength of character to be able to be unaffected by what they see, but has been carried out in the presence of children on a number of occasions.  Particularly in the light of his own reaction to both his past offences and the present offences, that he is not able either to remember or to give a sufficient explanation, it is certainly clear to this court that it cannot be guaranteed, far from it, that the existence, as Mr Jacobs submits, of the Sexual Offences Prevention Order in this case will at least prevent him from carrying out this kind of conduct in front of children.  As was suggested to us, it is plain that there is a risk that that will take place, notwithstanding the order, in front of children in the future, as indeed the probation officer concluded. 

 
We are wholly unpersuaded that there is any basis on which we can say that the learned judge did not have the evidence and/or was in any way unreasonable in reaching a conclusion here that there was jurisdiction to impose the order he did and that there was no basis for disapplying the statutory presumption that it was, in the light of the high risk of serious harm to others, appropriate that there was a requirement to impose at least an extended sentence, which is what the learned judge did.  We consequently dismiss this appeal.

LORD JUSTICE THOMAS: 

Introduction

 On 12 July 2007, at the Kingston Crown Court, a number of persons were sentenced by His Honour Judge Richard Haworth to periods of imprisonment after pleading guilty at various stages to an indictment which charged a conspiracy to supply significant quantities of a Class A drug (cocaine) and offences under the Firearms Act.

 

 Her Majesty's Attorney General applies for leave to refer to this court for review, under section 36 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988, the sentences passed on the two offenders, Alfie Hogg (who was then aged 27) and Neil Rolls (then aged 29) on the ground that she considers them unduly lenient.  We grant leave.

 

 There is also an application for leave to appeal against sentence by one of the others involved in this matter, Joe Anthony Roach, who is aged 19.  His application has been referred to the full court by the Registrar.  We shall deal with his application in the course of this judgment.

 

The offences
 The offenders Hogg and Rolls were charged with seven others on 

 
the count of conspiracy to which we have referred.  Hogg and another were in addition charged with the offences under the Firearms Act 1968.  Rolls and another were also charged with offences under the same Act.  The other defendants were charged with substantive drug offences. 

 On 16 February 2007, at a plea and case management hearing, Hogg pleaded guilty to conspiracy to supply a Class A drug, contrary to section 1(1) of the Criminal Law Act 1997.  A written basis of plea was not accepted by the Crown.  Roach and Carolan (another defendant) also pleaded guilty to the same offence on that date.  We shall have to return in some detail to the problems caused by the way Hogg's basis of plea was dealt with in this case.

 

 On 22 May 2007, Hogg pleaded guilty to possession of a firearm and possession of ammunition, contrary to sections 5(1)(aba) and 1(1)(b) of the Firearms Act 1968 respectively.  The pleas were entered following a Goodyear indication from the judge that the possession of a firearm and ammunition would not result in a consecutive sentence but would be treated as an aggravating feature.

 

 On 23 May 2007, Rolls pleaded guilty to the conspiracy and also to similar firearms offences.  He also pleaded guilty to possession of a firearm, namely a silencer, and ammunition contrary to sections 1(1)(a) and (b) of the same Act.  He also offered a written basis of plea which was not accepted by the Crown.

 

 On 13 June 2007, two of the other defendants pleaded guilty to possession with intent to supply a Class A drug.  They put forward bases of plea which were accepted by the Crown.  Another defendant, Kelly-Marie Franklin, pleaded guilty to being concerned in the supply of a Class A drug.  Her basis of plea was accepted by the Crown.  She stated that she was aware of the drugs found at premises to which we shall refer.  The Crown offered no evidence against the other defendants on the remaining counts.  In the result, although initially nine persons had been charged with the conspiracy, no evidence was offered against two.  

 

 On 12 July 2007, sentence was passed on all of the defendants as follows: Roach, eight years' detention in a young offender institution; Carolan, eight years' imprisonment; Shepherd, three years' imprisonment; Jennings, three years' imprisonment; and Kelly-Marie Franklin, nine months' imprisonment.  Hogg was sentenced to ten years' imprisonment for the drugs offence and a total of five years' imprisonment for the firearms offences, to run concurrently.  Rolls was sentenced to ten years' imprisonment for the drugs offence and to five years' imprisonment for each of the firearms offences, to run concurrently.

 

The preparation of the reference

 The way in which this case came before this court is the first detailed matter to which we must refer before turning to the facts.  As is usual a Draft Reference was prepared and approved by prosecution counsel in August 2007.  In accordance with the practice which has developed, those representing the offenders were invited to agree the factual content of the draft.  Those representing Hogg were sent the draft but failed to respond.  The last letter, which was sent on 11 September 2007, indicated that in the absence of any response it would be assumed that the factual content of the document was agreed.  Unfortunately, nothing was said by those acting on behalf of Hogg until a document dated 15 January 2008 (the day before yesterday) was sent to this court in which some challenges were made to the Reference.  We make no criticism of counsel who appears before us today as he was not involved in this case earlier.  However, those who represented Hogg should have dealt with matters at a very much earlier stage. 

 

 In Attorney General's Reference Nos 104 and 105 of 2007 (R v Padoan and Smith)[2008] EWCA Crim 216 (CA 2007/05564 and 05565/A7, 16.01.08) we made observations about the proper practice that should be followed in Attorney General's References where there were factual disputes.  The court was faced with significant difficulties, as was counsel who appeared on behalf of the Attorney General, because those who acted for the offenders had not responded to the Reference.

 

 In this case no particular problem has in the result emerged.  But we think it right to observe that in future those representing the Attorney General might wish to argue that if no response is made to the Draft Reference, then the Attorney may wish to argue in a proper case that the court should proceed to consider the matter on the basis of the Reference and not allow fresh factual issues to be gone into in this court.  The reason that such an argument may wish to be pursued is that it is extremely wasteful of time and limited resources if the document upon which the court is to proceed is not commented upon beforehand.  Any difference there may be ought to be identified by the Attorney and dealt with in documents submitted a long time in advance to the court, together with any supporting material.  Matters of dispute should not be raised at the last moment. 

 

 In the case of Rolls there was a response.  It was asked on his behalf that it be made clear that the throughput of drugs was an estimate; that there was no evidence that the credit cards found in his possession had been used in criminal activity; and that it be clarified as to whether it was submitted by the Attorney that the judge erred in failing to pass a consecutive sentence for the firearms offences.  The view was expressed that each of those matters had been addressed in the Final Consolidated Reference.  

 

The Judge's sentencing remarks

 Before turning to the details of the conspiracy and the submissions put forward by the Attorney General, it may be helpful to begin by setting out the sentencing remarks.  The judge referred to the guilty pleas and to the fact that the defendants would receive a substantial reduction in sentence.  He then stated that none of the defendants had any relevant previous convictions.  That is a matter to which we shall return.  He then continued:

 

		".... but this was large-scale commercial criminal activity.  

		It makes common sense to draw the inference that Hogg and Rolls were further up the hierarchy than Roach and Carolan.  For the reasons set out in the prosecution document Response to Basis of Plea, I do not sentence Hogg and Rolls on their basis of plea, although there is nothing to gainsay paragraph 3 of Hogg's basis and paragraph 4 of Rolls' basis.

		The prosecution allege that 50 kilograms of cocaine was involved on the basis of the bags and the quantity of cutting materials found in the factory and elsewhere.  Suffice it to say the quantity of cocaine was massive.  Hogg and Rolls ran the factory where the two cocaine presses were operated and where the cocaine was cut and packaged."]

 On 12 July 2007, sentence was passed on all of the defendants as follows: Roach, eight years' detention in a young offender institution; Carolan, eight years' imprisonment; Shepherd, three years' imprisonment; Jennings, three years' imprisonment; and Kelly-Marie Franklin, nine months' imprisonment.  Hogg was sentenced to ten years' imprisonment for the drugs offence and a total of five years' imprisonment for the firearms offences, to run concurrently.  Rolls was sentenced to ten years' imprisonment for the drugs offence and to five years' imprisonment for each of the firearms offences, to run concurrently.

 

The preparation of the reference

 The way in which this case came before this court is the first detailed matter to which we must refer before turning to the facts.  As is usual a Draft Reference was prepared and approved by prosecution counsel in August 2007.  In accordance with the practice which has developed, those representing the offenders were invited to agree the factual content of the draft.  Those representing Hogg were sent the draft but failed to respond.  The last letter, which was sent on 11 September 2007, indicated that in the absence of any response it would be assumed that the factual content of the document was agreed.  Unfortunately, nothing was said by those acting on behalf of Hogg until a document dated 15 January 2008 (the day before yesterday) was sent to this court in which some challenges were made to the Reference.  We make no criticism of counsel who appears before us today as he was not involved in this case earlier.  However, those who represented Hogg should have dealt with matters at a very much earlier stage. 

 

 In Attorney General's Reference Nos 104 and 105 of 2007 (R v Padoan and Smith)[2008] EWCA Crim 216 (CA 2007/05564 and 05565/A7, 16.01.08) we made observations about the proper practice that should be followed in Attorney General's References where there were factual disputes.  The court was faced with significant difficulties, as was counsel who appeared on behalf of the Attorney General, because those who acted for the offenders had not responded to the Reference.

 

 In this case no particular problem has in the result emerged.  But we think it right to observe that in future those representing the Attorney General might wish to argue that if no response is made to the Draft Reference, then the Attorney may wish to argue in a proper case that the court should proceed to consider the matter on the basis of the Reference and not allow fresh factual issues to be gone into in this court.  The reason that such an argument may wish to be pursued is that it is extremely wasteful of time and limited resources if the document upon which the court is to proceed is not commented upon beforehand.  Any difference there may be ought to be identified by the Attorney and dealt with in documents submitted a long time in advance to the court, together with any supporting material.  Matters of dispute should not be raised at the last moment. 

 

 In the case of Rolls there was a response.  It was asked on his behalf that it be made clear that the throughput of drugs was an estimate; that there was no evidence that the credit cards found in his possession had been used in criminal activity; and that it be clarified as to whether it was submitted by the Attorney that the judge erred in failing to pass a consecutive sentence for the firearms offences.  The view was expressed that each of those matters had been addressed in the Final Consolidated Reference.  

 

The Judge's sentencing remarks

 Before turning to the details of the conspiracy and the submissions put forward by the Attorney General, it may be helpful to begin by setting out the sentencing remarks.  The judge referred to the guilty pleas and to the fact that the defendants would receive a substantial reduction in sentence.  He then stated that none of the defendants had any relevant previous convictions.  That is a matter to which we shall return.  He then continued:

 

		".... but this was large-scale commercial criminal activity.  

		It makes common sense to draw the inference that Hogg and Rolls were further up the hierarchy than Roach and Carolan.  For the reasons set out in the prosecution document Response to Basis of Plea, I do not sentence Hogg and Rolls on their basis of plea, although there is nothing to gainsay paragraph 3 of Hogg's basis and paragraph 4 of Rolls' basis.

		The prosecution allege that 50 kilograms of cocaine was involved on the basis of the bags and the quantity of cutting materials found in the factory and elsewhere.  Suffice it to say the quantity of cocaine was massive.  Hogg and Rolls ran the factory where the two cocaine presses were operated and where the cocaine was cut and packaged."]
[
	MR JUSTICE WYN WILLIAMS:  On 22 August 2007, before HHJ Hoffman sitting at the Crown Court at York, the appellant pleaded guilty to an offence of wounding, contrary to section 20 of the Offences Against The Person Act 1861.  On 4 October 2007, the same judge sentenced the appellant to a term of 33 months' imprisonment.  The appellant appeals against that sentence with leave of the Single Judge.

 
	The incident giving rise to the proceedings against the Appellant took place in a public house in Harrogate known as the Slip Inn on 12 March 2007.  The public house is a small one usually frequented by regular customers.  At the material time two such customers were the appellant and a man called Peter Kemp.  Both were present in the public house on 12 March together with about five other people.  Towards the end of the evening, at about 10pm a person, or more than one person, was in the pub with the appellant and he or they spoke to Mr Kemp.  Something occurred to cause the conversation between those men to become heated.  The appellant joined in with the conversation and this much is common ground that as the conversation came to an end Mr Kemp called the appellant a "prick".  

 
	What happened next is the subject of some confusion in the sense that the witness statements taken by the police officers did not all agree about the precise sequence of events and what the appellant did.  However, the sentencing judge proceeded on this basis that Mr Kemp turned away from the appellant and began to walk back to the place where he had been having a drink and it was while he had his back turned to the appellant that he was attacked by him.  The attack took this form: the appellant struck Mr Kemp at least two blows.  He did that while he was holding a glass.  The judge found that after the first blow had been struck the glass was broken, so that it followed that the second, and any subsequent blow, was with a broken glass.  The blows which were struck with the glass were to the sides of Mr Kemp's head.  Those blows caused him to go to the ground.  The attack was aggravated by the fact that whilst Mr Kemp was on the ground the appellant kicked him twice.

 
	As a consequence of this attack Mr Kemp suffered distinct lacerations on each side of his head.  Fortunately the injuries can properly be regarded as transient, but, in the circumstances, that might easily not have been the case.

 
	Following this incident the appellant was charged not with an offence of wounding, but with wounding with intent.  When the indictment was drawn it was wounding with intent which was the offence that was placed upon the indictment.  At a preliminary hearing, on 18 May 2007, the appellant indicated that his plea to that offence would be "not guilty", but he also indicated a willingness to plead to wounding.  At that stage such a plea was not acceptable to the prosecution.  

 
	The same stance remained, so far as the prosecution was concerned, when a plea and directions hearing took place on 10 August and accordingly a trial was fixed.  However, on the day of the trial the appellant was informed by his counsel, after discussions with the prosecution, that a plea to section 20 was acceptable to the prosecution and at that stage he entered that plea.  Counsel for the appellant submits that this course was not one with which Judge Hoffman concurred.  That may be correct.  However, it remains the case that the discussions between counsel resulted in the course which was taken and the learned judge did nothing, in the end, to interfere with that course.

 
	Mr Gioserano, counsel for the appellant, makes one essential submission and that is that a sentence of 33 months was too long for this offence.  He submits, quite correctly, that the appellant was entitled to full credit for his plea of guilty and that being so he submits that the judge's starting point for his sentence was a sentence after trial in excess of four years.  Counsel submits that although this was a serious offence, on any view, it was not such so as to attract a sentence which is quite close to the maximum available.

 
	In making that submission he relies upon two decisions of this court.  The first decision which he cites is the case of Robertson  (1998) 1 C app R (S) 21.  The second case is that of Singleton (1998) 1 Cr App R (S) 199.  In our judgment the case of Singleton is one which may not be decided in the same way in the current sentencing climate.  Counsel for the applicant conceded as much during the course of this oral application. The case of Robertson, however, does contain general views expressed by the court which we need address.  Robertson involved the glassing of a man in a public house.  He was drinking in the public house when he attacked a man by thrusting a beer glass into the left side of his face.  The glass broke on impact and caused wounds to the victim's face.  Mr Robertson pleaded guilty to unlawful wounding and the sentencing judge imposed a sentence of two-and-a-half years' imprisonment.  

 
	This court reduced the sentence from two-and-a-half years to two years.  During the course of giving the judgment of the court, Latham J, as he then was, reviewed a number of authorities dealing with offences of section 20 and then said this:  

 
"The position in our judgment is that, in the light of those authorities, the Court should look with some care at sentences over two years' imprisonment for an offence under section 20 to see whether in truth there is a real justification for a sentence of the length in question on the facts of the particular case." 
Then he went on to refer to the personal mitigation available to the appellant in that case.  He said:  
"...in our judgment the mitigation, namely his plea, his undoubted remorse and the fact that he appears to have taken steps to address his alcohol abuse, do not in our view justify the conclusion that the circumstances of this case necessitate a sentence of more than two years' imprisonment." 
In his sentencing remarks Judge Hoffman distinguished both Robertson and Singleton on the basis that each of those cases involved one single blow with a glass, whereas in the instant case there were at least two blows with a glass followed by two kicks to the victim while he lay on the floor.  In our judgment Judge Hoffman was correct to distinguish those decisions on that basis.  
	In our view this case on its facts is significantly worse than either Robertson or Singleton.  However, in the light of the more general point made by the Court in Robertson we propose to look closely at the issue as to what extent, if any, a sentence in excess of two years is justified in this case.  

 
	We begin our scrutiny by asking the question: what is the correct starting point after a trial for sentence for this appellant in relation to this offence?  Is it something over four years, as the judge clearly thought, or is that too high?  In fixing the appropriate length of course we must consider not just the circumstances of the offence, but also the personal mitigation available to the offender.  The appellant is 30 years old, 29 at the time of the offence.  He has no relevant previous conviction.  Lest that be thought to be doing less than justice to his previous character, we should say that he has one conviction for a minor offence involving a vehicle.  

 
	He is hard-working, or at least was until his conviction for this offence, and he is spoken of highly in a number of written references.  The pre-sentence report described the risk of his re-offending as low.  He has always, as we have indicated, been prepared to plead guilty to section 20.  In a short report from the prison at which he is serving his sentence it is clear that the appellant is responding well to his incarceration.  That, in itself, of course, does not affect the appropriate starting point for sentence directly, but does give some insight into whether expressions of remorse, and the like, are genuinely made.  

 
	In our judgment, balancing the serious nature of the assault against the personal mitigation available to the appellant, and for the moment ignoring discount for guilty plea, we consider that the appropriate sentence after a trial would have been of the order of about three-and-a-half years' imprisonment.  Taking that as our starting point, we think that the appropriate sentence in this case, after giving credit for the guilty plea, would have been one of 27 months.  

 
	We propose to quash the sentence of 33 months imprisonment and substitute one of 27 months.  To that extent, this appeal is allowed.  

 
	LADY JUSTICE HALLETT:  Thank you very much.

[

	MR JUSTICE WILKIE:  This is the appeal by John Middleton and Veronica Patricia Rourke, now aged 56 and 51 respectively, against certain convictions in the Crown Court at Truro on 13th February 2007.  They bring these appeals by leave of the single judge.

 
	They were each convicted on an amended indictment number T20060084 which contained three counts.  Count 1 charged them with converting the proceeds of drug trafficking, contrary to section 49(1)(b) of the Drug Trafficking Act 1994.  The particulars of the offence were that between 31st December 1999 and 24th February 2003 they converted property, namely money to the value of approximately £103,000, for the purpose of avoiding prosecution for a drug trafficking offence or the making of a confiscation order.

 
	Count 2 charged them with converting criminal property, contrary to section 327(1)(c) of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002.  The particulars of the offence were that between the 23rd day of February 2003 and the 29th day of June 2005 they converted criminal property to the value of approximately £70,000.

 
	Count 3 charged them with possession of criminal property, contrary to section 329(1)(c) of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002.  The particulars of that count were that on 28th June 2005 they had in their possession criminal property, namely £21,485 in cash.

 
	On 13th February 2007 the jury convicted them of each of counts 1, 2 and 3.  They appeal against the convictions only in respect of counts 1 and 2.

 
	Prior to that trial the appellant Middleton had pleaded guilty on separate occasions to counts of possession of a class C drug (cannabis) with intent to supply.

 
	Subsequent to their conviction, they were each in due course sentenced on counts 1, 2 and 3 on the present indictment, to sentences of 12 months on each concurrent.  The appellant Middleton was also sentenced in relation to the earlier two indictments and on each of the two counts of possession with intent to supply of cannabis, he received sentences of 30 months to run concurrently one with the other and concurrently with the sentences imposed in respect of counts 1 to 3.

 
	The facts leading to their convictions are as follows.  The appellants lived together with their children at an address, 10 Hawkins Road, Newquay.  They also owned a garage at Whitewalls in the town of Perrancoombe.  In June 2005 the police executed search warrants at their home address, resulting in seizure of 8.8 kilograms of cannabis resin, a set of digital scales, a list of names and figures and three quantities of cash: £975 found in clothing, £2,000 in an airing cupboard and £18,500 under the floorboards.  These were the matters in respect of which Mr Middleton pleaded guilty on 8th July 2005 to a charge of possession of a class C drug with intent to supply.  The money which was found on that occasion formed the subject matter of count 3 on the indictment with which we are concerned.

 
	On 5th September 2005 police officers executed a search warrant at the Whitewalls garage, there seizing 11.5 kilograms of cannabis resin being stored in tins concealed beneath some boarding in a cupboard.  The following words were written on one of the boards "Keep your fucking thieving hands off are [sic] I will batter you.  You know I fucking know how."  Middleton was charged with possession of that class C drug with intent to supply, and that is the matter to which he pleaded guilty to which we have already referred.

 
	The police conducted an investigation into the appellants' finances, resulting in a financial report referred to as "the Tracker".  The purpose of this document was to compare their known income with expenditure over the period 1999 to 2005.  That document was analysed by forensic accountants on behalf of each of the appellants and also on behalf of the Crown by Mr Frampton, who both reviewed the Tracker and commented upon the findings of the defence experts.

 
	At the trial the three accountants produced a joint statement setting out the areas upon which they had reached agreement.  They agreed that the Tracker's calculations were incorrect and that their differing figures, although using different accounting approaches, would probably be capable of reconciliation.  They were able to agree an "unexplained income" figure of £44,698 once all the appellants' known sources of income had been deducted from their total expenditure for the period 2000 to 2005.  The defence experts and their reports were not adduced in evidence before the jury, but Mr Frampton was called and his report relied on by the Crown.

 
	The prosecution case was that Middleton was involved in the commercial supply of cannabis and that he Rourke together laundered the profits.  They were alleged to have converted somewhere between £44,698 and £173,000 over a five-year period.  Count 1 concerned the period from December 1999 to February 2003, which was the period covered by the Drug Trafficking Act 1994.  It was said that up to £103,000 had been converted in that period.  Count 2 related to February 2003 to June 2005, a period covered by the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002.  It was alleged that up to £70,000 was converted during that period.  As we have indicated, count 3 concerned the cash found at the family home in June 2005 which exceeded £21,000, which it was said represented the proceeds of crime.

 
	The Crown accepted that the appellants had some legitimate income arising from caravan rentals and from Mr Middleton's self-employment, but it was the prosecution case that they had grossly inflated their legitimate income figures in order to account for the significant shortfall in relation to their expenditure.  The prosecution invited the jury to draw the inference that the source of the unexplained income was payments relating to drug trafficking, and that the seizures of cannabis from the appellants' properties demonstrated the nature and scale of the enterprise.

 
	The case of Middleton was that he was minding the cannabis for a friend and did not profit from the arrangement.  He denied being a drug dealer and denied being involved in the conversion of criminal proceeds.  He was self-employed and had had a number of different legitimate sources of income over the years, including building work, gardening and selling.  Any apparently unexplained income was due to the chaotic nature of his finances.

 
	The case of Rourke, with which Mr Middleton agreed, was that she had no knowledge of the cannabis found at their property and did not know or suspect that Middleton was involved with drugs.  She denied being involved in the conversion of the proceeds of crime and believed that all her income was from legitimate sources.  She accepted she may have failed to declare income to the Inland Revenue, but she had failed to keep proper financial records as an explanation for that.

 
	The evidence placed before the jury was as follows.  Detective Constable Mamaton gave evidence about the value of the drugs seized and gave evidence of her opinion that the drawings seized during the June 2005 searches were of a proposed hydroponics unit and that the list of names and figures seized was a dealer list, the figures on that list varying from between £20 to £6,000.

 
	Mr Frampton, the forensic accountant, gave evidence of his detailed analysis of the couple's finances.  He took the view that because of lack of information in relation to 1999, figures for that year should be ignored.  He gave evidence supporting his figure of an unexplained income between 2000 and 2005 of the sum of £44,000-odd, to which we have already referred.

 
	Paul Hoyte, from Trenance Holiday Park, gave evidence as to how that business worked and the profits that could be made.  He confirmed that the appellants owned several caravans at this holiday park which were let out.  They paid him ground rent and could expect to make around £450 per caravan per week in high season.

 
	Phillip Francis, a Customs officer, gave evidence that on 11th February 2005 Mr Middleton was stopped at Bristol airport as he was about to board a flight to Spain.  He was carrying just under £10,000 in cash.  When questioned, he told the officer that the money was intended to be used as a deposit on a property in Spain.

 
	John Lobb gave evidence of Mr Middleton's claim to have earned money in the late 1990s by clearing out a restaurant called the Clock Tower which had suffered a fire, and that he had sold Mr Lobb the restaurant chairs.  He confirmed that he had bought 30 to 40 chairs from the burnt-out restaurant, but this was in mid-1990s and he paid £5 to £6 for each.

 
	Janice Cobley of the Ambassador Hotel gave evidence concerning Mr Middleton's claim to have earned cash from carrying out roofing repairs at the Hotel.  She stated that she had no record of Mr Middleton having carried out any such work, and in any event she never paid workmen in cash.

 
	Malcolm Pelmear gave evidence in relation to Mr Middleton's claim to have carried out roofing work at Newquay railway station.  Mr Pelmear was employed by Network Rail, was involved in the management of the station and said he could find no record of Mr Middleton having carried out any such work.

 
	Evidence was given of the interviews conducted with the appellants.  Each had denied being involved in drug dealing or money laundering.  They made no comment to some of the questions asked.  Mr Middleton handed a prepared statement which said that he would be able to answer all allegations in due course by explaining all the legitimate sources of his earnings.  He was asked about the list of names that had been seized from his house and said that he knew nothing about it.  He was asked about the writing on the boards at the Whitewalls garage and said he was not responsible for that.  When asked about the drawings, he said he had not seen them before.

 
	Mr Middleton gave evidence about what he said were his legitimate business interests.  He said that because of the chaotic nature of their finances, he and Rourke may have significantly underestimated their earnings for the indictment period.  He said that he always worked: he had been a salesman, worked in the building trade and in factories, and he had done landscape gardening and rubbish clearance.  He admitted that he withheld information about his income from the Inland Revenue and that he kept no proper record of his earnings.  He said in the late 1990s, following a fire at the Clock Tower restaurant, he earned £10,000 from clearing the premises and selling the chairs to Mr Lobb.  He had inherited money from a relative, which accounted for the £20,000 in the safe found by the police in June 2005.  He said that he and Rourke earned a good income from the caravan rentals and from property in Spain.

 
	With regard to the money he made from his own work, he would often be paid in cash and would put it away in various places around the house without the knowledge of Rourke, which explained the cash that was found by police during their searches.  He denied that any of his money came from drug dealing, but he said that because of the lack of written records it was difficult to remember details of jobs he had done five or six years previously.

 
	As far as the cannabis was concerned, he said he was doing some work with a friend one day at the garage at Whitewalls when another friend appeared and asked whether he could hide his drugs there.  Middleton agreed and gave this friend a key to the premises.  Later that day the friend turned up at his home address and asked him to look after some more cannabis which was stored in tins.  He thought this was some time during the week prior to 28th June 2005.  That was how he came to be in possession of some 20 kilograms of cannabis.  He was minding it for this friend.

 
	One day he noticed that some of the cannabis at the garage had gone missing, and he suspected the other friend who had been helping him to have taken it.  That was why he wrote the warning words on the walls.  He admitted lying about that writing in interview because he thought it would incriminate him.  In relation to the list of names and figures, he admitted that it was writing but stated that it was simply jobs that he had priced.  When asked why he had lied in interview, he said he had not told the police the whole truth because he had felt that his income was none of their business.

 
	Ms Rourke gave evidence that she had no knowledge of the drugs found by police and that Mr Middleton would not have told her that he was hiding them for a friend because he would have known that she would have disapproved.  She was not involved in or aware of drug dealing and believed all the family income was legitimately earned.  Their caravan rental business was a cash business.  She used the cash for day-to-day expenses rather than banking it.  With five caravans she could earn about £35,000 to £44,000 a year.  She conceded she had made inaccurate returns to the Inland Revenue and that she in fact earned more from the business than she has suggested in interview.  She and Mr Middleton did not keep proper business records.  She was aware that Mr Middleton used to keep cash around the house, but did not ask him about it.  They were largely financially independent of one another.  The property they had bought in Spain was funded partly from the caravan rental profits and partly by a loan.

 
	At the outset of the trial on 29th January 2007 the appellants sought to have counts 1 and 2 quashed on the basis that they were bad for duplicity.  The argument was that there were identifiable transactions throughout the period covered by these counts which could and should have been individually isolated to allege specific acts of money laundering or conversion of criminal property.  The judge, in ruling against the appellants, acknowledged that, by way of analogy with charges under the Theft Act, it is only in very limited circumstances that it is possible for the prosecution to charge rolled-up or general deficiency counts.  Otherwise the Crown must specify, if need be by way of specimen counts rather than citing every single transaction, individual instances of theft, so as to reflect the criminality charged.  However, the judge concluded that the legislation under which these offences were being charged, in his judgment, permitted the prosecution to conduct the case in the way that it had and that there was nothing in the legislation itself which precluded such an approach, though he indicated that he would keep a weather eye on the way the case developed. 

 
	At the conclusion of the evidence, counsel for Middleton invited the judge to indicate how he intended to direct the jury of the minimum sum of which they had to be satisfied before they could convict his client on count 1 and/or count 2.  The judge indicated that he was not prepared to contemplate leaving the case for the jury on the basis that "approximately" in the indictment might mean anything upwards of the £44,698 which comprised the so-called unexplained income.  This would mean that, even if the jury were to accept that the defence case in respect of their respective legitimate incomes may be to any extent right, they would nonetheless still face conviction on these counts.

 
	Immediately before the defence closing speeches, the judge indicated that he would direct the jury to the effect that "approximately" meant "within 20% of the figure indicated".  The judge directed the jury in the following terms:

 
"The Prosecution say that the maximum amount of overspend, approximately, that they simply cannot account [for] is £173,000 - £103,000 in the first count and £70,000 in the second.  There is also a minimum bottom line of £44,698.  But the Prosecution have chosen to allege the counts in the way that they have.  They have freedom to make the allegations within the law in whatever way they like and they have chosen to say 'approximately £103,000' and 'approximately £70,000' respectively Counts 1 and 2.  And they have not put a bracket on it, they have just used that expression 'approximately' so that is what they must prove.
But 'approximately' must mean something and I direct you that unless you are sure that the Prosecution have got within 20% of those figures, then you should not convict, assuming you find all the rest of the necessary ingredients proved.  So, in rough terms, and use these figures because they are approximately 20%, unless you are sure in Count 1 that it has been proved that criminal money, drugs money, of £80,000 or more, up to a maximum of £103,000, or in the case of Count 2, £55,000 up to a maximum of £70,000, you may not convict, but within that bracket the Prosecution can succeed."
	The case at trial for both the prosecution and the defence focused on three major elements, within each of which there were subsidiary issues of fact.  The first element was "unexplained other income".  That comprised a series of figures, from 2000 through to 2005, which the forensic accountants agreed could not be explained as income from any source at all.  That sum totalled £44,698.  Had the Crown not been able to prove anything beyond that figure then, in accordance with the judge's direction to the jury, there could not have been a conviction on either count 1 or count 2.

 
	The second element was the income which Mr Middleton asserted he derived from legitimate self-employment of various types.  That figure was identified for each of the years 2000 to 2005.  It totalled £83,500.  In accordance with the judge's direction, if the jury had been satisfied so that they were sure that none of Mr Middleton's claimed legitimate income was legitimate income and they were also satisfied that the "unexplained other income" came from drug money, then, nonetheless, the prosecution would not have succeeded in reaching the more than 80% mark.  Thus there could not be a conviction on either counts 1 or 2.

 
	The third element constituted the income of the appellant Rourke.  She claimed that the entirety of her income derived from renting a number of caravans at the Trenance Holiday Park which she owned.  The Crown's case was that it accepted that to some extent she did derive legitimate income from that business.  Their case was that it was limited to those payments which were paid into her bank account direct from her tenants.  There was, in respect of each of the years 2000 to 2005, a balance which represented unbanked income.  The Crown said that none of that balance derived from that legitimate business but it derived from drug dealing money.  The Crown was able, through the analysis of bank accounts, to identify how much that "unbanked" income of Rourke was in each of the years 2000 to 2005.  Again, had the jury been satisfied so that they were sure that the Crown had satisfied them that none of that money was legitimate, then, even if they were sure that one or other of the other elements was proved, they would not convict of either of counts 1 or 2 because the more than 80% test had not been satisfied.

 
	Thus, the effect of the judge's direction to the jury was that they could only convict either appellant of either counts 1 or 2 if they were satisfied so that they were sure that income from each of the three elements was not legitimate but derived from drug dealing money and were sure of sufficient in each of the three categories such that at least 80% of their unexplained or dubiously explained income derived from drug dealing.

 
	The appellants accept that this direction went a long way towards safeguarding them from the risk that they might be convicted of significant money laundering offences, where the jury were only satisfied of a relatively small portion of the sums alleged by the Crown.  They say, however, that the decision of the judge to permit the Crown to proceed on counts 1 and 2, drafted in that general way, was wrong as a matter of principle and not saved by his specific direction to the jury.

 
The law 
	The Indictment Rules 1971 have been revoked by the Criminal Procedure (Amendment) Rules 2007 which (by Rule 9) inserted a new Part 14 in the 2005 Criminal Procedure Rules to make fresh provision as to the form, content, signature and service of indictments.  Rule 14.2 of the 2005 Rules (as amended) concern the form and content of indictment.  They read, insofar as is relevant, as follows:

 
"14.2(1).  An indictment must be in one of the forms set out in the Practice Direction and must contain, in a paragraph called a 'count' -
 (a) a statement of the offence charged ... 
 (b) such particulars of the conduct constituting the commission of the offence as to make clear what the prosecutor alleges against the defendant.
 (2) More than one incident of the commission of the offence may be included in a count if those incidents taken together amount to a course of conduct having regard to the time, place or purpose of commission."
	Practice direction (Criminal Proceedings: Consolidation) paragraphs IV.34.8 to IV.34.12, as inserted by the Practice Direction (Criminal Proceedings: Further Directions) [2007] 1 WLR 1790, states, insofar as is relevant, as follows:

 
"IV.34.8.  Rule 14.2(2) of the Criminal Procedure Rules 2005 allows a single count to allege more than one incident of the commission of an offence in certain circumstances.  Each incident must be of the same offence.  The circumstances in which such a count may be appropriate include, but are not limited to, the following:
 (a) the victim on each occasion was the same, or there was no identifiable individual victim as, for example, in a case of the unlawful importation of controlled drugs or of money laundering;
 (b) the alleged incidents involved a marked degree of repetition in the method employed or in their location, or both;
 (c) the alleged incidents took place over a clearly defined period, typically (but not necessarily) no more than about a year;
 (d) in any event, the defence is such as to apply to every alleged incident without differentiation.  Where what is in issue differs between different incidents, a single 'multiple incidents' count will not be appropriate, though it may be appropriate to use two or more such counts according to the circumstances and to the issues raised by the defence.  ...
IV.34.11.  In some cases, such as money laundering or theft, there will be documented evidence of individual incidents but the sheer number of these will make it desirable to cover them in a single count.  Where the indictment contains a count alleging multiple incidents of the commission of such offences, and during the course of the trial it becomes clear that the jury may bring in a verdict in relation to a lesser amount than that alleged by the prosecution, it will normally be desirable to direct the jury that they should return a partial verdict with reference to that lesser amount."
	The explanatory memorandum to the Practice Direction states that the Criminal Procedure Rule Committee was "satisfied that the new rule reflects what judgments of the House of Lords in the past have found consistent with fundamental principles of fairness." 

 
	The trial in this case was not governed by the 2007 amendment to the Criminal Procedure Rules 2005.  We note, however, that the Criminal Procedure Rules Committee considered that they were doing no more than codifying the existing law in formulating Rule 14.2(2) and giving guidance in Practice Direction IV.34.8 and IV.34.11.  The learned editors of Archbold surmise, in our judgment correctly, that the Committee had in mind in that regard the speech of Lord Diplock in Director of Public Prosecutions v Merriman [1973] AC 584 HL at 607 at which he said at letter C:

 
"The rule against duplicity, viz. that only one offence should be charged in any count of an indictment,  ... has always been applied in a practical, rather than in a strictly analytical, way for the purpose of determining what constituted one offence.  Where a number of acts of a similar nature committed by one or more defendants were connected with one another, in the time and place of their commission or by their common purpose, in such a way that they could fairly be regarded as forming part of the same transaction or criminal enterprise, it was the practice, as early as the eighteenth century, to charge them in a single count of an indictment."
	The most recent description of this practice and its justification is to be found in the judgment of the Divisional Court in Barton v Director of Public Prosecutions [2001] EWHC Admin 223, in which at paragraph 6 Kennedy LJ said:

 
"... where the individual transactions are known but where there are many transactions of the same type, frequently individually of small value, against the same victim, and it is convenient in order to reflect the overall criminality to put them together in one information, or one count, so that if the criminality can be proved, without prejudice to the defendant and having regard to the known defence, then the court will be in a position to sentence appropriately."
	And at paragraphs 22 to 23:

 
"22.  ...  Specimen counts or specimen informations are no longer a possibility, in the light of relatively recent decisions of this Court and of the Court of Appeal Criminal Division.  To have 94 separate informations would have rightly been regarded as oppressive. ...
23.  ... This is not a case where she had put forward a specific answer to some of the alleged takings and not to others, and that then specific answers needed to be considered separately.  ...  The Magistrate was able to, and did in fact, give credit for the amount that he was not satisfied had been taken.  So far as I can ascertain there was no discernible prejudice or unfairness to the appellant in regarding this as a continuous offence within the principles set out in the authorities to which I have referred."
The appellants' submissions 
	Mr Middleton accepts that the number of discrete offences, based on each individual transaction which was identifiable, would have involved preparing and incorporating a schedule running to many of hundreds, indeed thousands, of entries because it was the Crown's case that every financial transaction which Mr Middleton had effected over the period of the indictment was a conversion of the proceeds of drug trafficking.  It is contended that what the Crown could and should have done was to charge a small number of these credits, year by year, as specimen or sample counts.  The appellant has identified in a schedule, setting out two counts per year, 12 individual banking transactions the value of which totals under £10,000.  In addition, in relation to the numerous secondary transactions, where the Crown have asserted that goods paid for by cash, cheque or credit card transactions constituted fresh acts of conversion, he has identified, by way of specimen counts, a further 11 totalling about £45,000.  Furthermore, the appellant has identified four large purchases, of value just over £100,000, of various properties said to involve conversion.

 
	In that way it is said that it was practicable for the Crown to identify discrete offences sufficiently few in number to have been accommodated by the jury, but reflecting the overall scale of the criminality.

 
	It is said that the unfairness of the Crown's approach meant that he could potentially have faced conviction, whether or not the jury concluded that he had been dealing in drugs throughout the period or whether they only concluded that he had so dealt for some lesser period, and it was pointed out that the evidence of drug dealing was much more convincing in relation to the latter period rather than in the earlier years.  The jury was not in a position, by its verdicts, to reveal such a decision.  It is accepted that the judge's intervention, by the direction to which we have referred, mitigated very substantially this intrinsic unfairness.  The point of principle, however, remains that, wherever possible, individual charges ought to be formulated in respect of individual transactions or events, so that the defendants know precisely the charge they face and have a fair opportunity of adducing focused evidence to meet the charge concerned.  General deficiency counts ought, it is submitted, to be strictly confined to circumstances where it is genuinely impossible for the Crown to formulate specific counts, including, if need be, sample counts which are adequate to allow a jury to decide about the overall wrongdoing alleged.

 
	The appellant Rourke adopts these submissions.

 
The Crown's submissions 
	The Crown's submissions are that the prosecution case was that Mr Middleton was a drug trafficker.  They rejected his assertion that he was minding drugs for another on the occasions when they were found in his possession.  They alleged he had been involved in the supply of drugs for a number of years, though there was no direct evidence of previous incidents of supply.  They relied upon an analysis of the financial position of the appellants between 2000 and 2005 to support that assertion.  Counts 1 and 2 involved the application of the principle of general deficiency which was both necessary and fair.

 
	It is said that the description of the circumstances in which a general deficiency would be available in Merriman is satisfied.  The analysis of the three known sources of income of Mr Middleton and Ms Rourke which underpinned counts 1 and 2 required the jury to focus on the three areas which we have identified.  In respect of each, it was said the Crown was unable to identify individual transactions as involving the conversion of criminal property because the Crown accepted that the appellants had been in receipt of some legitimate income, albeit limited in amount.  Thus the prosecution could not allege that individual cash credits, or identified specific purchases, constituted acts of conversion so as appropriately to be charged as discrete charges.  This was not a case where, for example, the prosecution was able to point, in evidence, to any particular event which took place immediately prior to a particular transaction so as to give rise to an inference that such transaction was connected with the supply of drugs.

 
	On the issue of fairness, the Crown relies on the direction given by the judge that before the jury could properly convict either appellant they had to be sure that they had converted at least 80% of the sum alleged in the individual count.  That would, of necessity, mean that the jury, before convicting, would have to be sure that for at least five of the six years between 2000 and 2005 the appellants were converting the proceeds of drug trafficking to the scale suggested by the Crown and that the jury rejected the innocent explanations given by the appellants in respect of each of the three categories of income.  It was unavoidable, say the Crown, that the figures set out in the indictment were imprecise because the prosecution was unable to apportion a specific figure for the legitimate work which the appellants had carried out.

 
Our conclusions 
	In our judgment the prosecution is correct in its submissions.  The prosecution case was that each of the appellants had been involved in a course of conduct, drug dealing (Mr Middleton) and (both appellants) converting the proceeds of such dealing over a number of years.  They had done so in a huge number of individual transactions, mostly small in scale.  Intermingled with that illegal activity, the prosecution accepted, was some legitimate activity on the part of each of the appellants.  It was impossible to untangle that activity, save that, in the case of Ms Rourke, the prosecution asserted that there was a distinction to be drawn between the direct banking of income from customers of her legitimate activity and banking of cash by her arising out of Middleton's drug trafficking.

 
	It would have been unduly oppressive and onerous to have identified each and every individual transaction as separate counts.  Furthermore, to have adopted a relatively small number of discrete specimen counts would have given rise to two problems.  First, even if convicted, the powers of the judge in sentencing would have been constrained by authority so as to be limited to those specimen counts which had been proved.  Second, in any event, the prosecution was unable to say, of any individual transaction, that the jury could be sure that the money involved derived from drug trafficking.  It was the scale of the informal transactions, and the paucity and untruthfulness of the evidence from the appellants to justify that level of economic activity as legitimate, which was the essence of the Crown's case.

 
	In our judgment, therefore, it was legitimate for the Crown to proceed with counts alleging general deficiency.  They chose to do so by two counts only, each covering a number of years and separated only by reference to the different statutory regimes which applied at different times.  In our judgment this was a high risk strategy and, on its own, might have given rise to unfairness.  The point is well made by the appellants that, by not dividing the period into individual years, by way of example, the Crown was inviting the jury to consider activity over two lengthy periods, rather than what may still have been significant, but lesser, periods within the overall time frame.  Without any mediation, this might have led to convictions by the jury for criminality significantly less serious than alleged by the Crown but of which the judge in sentencing would have been unaware.  However, the judge, in a sensible approach to managing the case for the benefit of the jury and the appellants, by his direction ensured that convictions on each of counts 1 and 2 would reflect that the jury was sure that the appellants were guilty of the criminal activity alleged and on the scale alleged.

 
	In our judgment, therefore, neither count 1 nor count 2 was unlawfully duplicitous in itself.  They involved a continuing activity, or general deficiency, falling within the authorities, nor, in the event, did they give rise to unfairness.  In those circumstances, in respect of these arguments, the verdicts of the jury were not unsafe.

 
Ms Rourke's separate point 
	The appellant Ms Rourke raises an additional point.  She says she could not, in law, be guilty of count 1.  This count charges her, under section 49(1)(b) of the 1994 Drug Trafficking Act, with converting property "for the purpose of avoiding prosecution for a drug trafficking offence or the making of a confiscation order."  It is said that, as she has never been charged in respect of a drug trafficking offence nor been convicted of one, she could not be the subject of such a charge as she could not act for the prohibited purpose as she was neither threatened with prosecution nor, after conviction, the making of a confiscation order.

 
	It is said that the judge erred in law in directing the jury that the prosecution could establish her guilt if she was acting together with her husband for the purpose of avoiding his prosecution as a drug trafficker or the making of a confiscation order in the event of his conviction as such.

 
	Section 49 of the Drug Trafficking Act 1994 reads, insofar as is relevant, as follows:

 
"(1) A person is guilty of an offence if he  
 (a) conceals or disguises any property which is, or in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents, his proceeds of drug trafficking, or 
 (b) converts or transfers that property or removes it from the jurisdiction,
for the purpose of avoiding prosecution for a drug trafficking offence or the making or enforcement in his case of a confiscation order.
 (2) A person is guilty of an offence if, knowing or having reasonable grounds to suspect that any property is, or in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents, another person's proceeds of drug trafficking, he  
 (a) conceals or disguises that property, or 
 (b) converts or transfers that property or removes it from the jurisdiction,
for the purpose of assisting any person to avoid prosecution for a drug trafficking offence or the making or enforcement of a confiscation order."
	Ms Rourke says that the appropriate offence to have charged her with on the facts of this case was an offence under section 49(2).  Indeed, it is the case that at the conclusion of the prosecution case submissions were made to the effect that that was the appropriate charge, rather than a charge under section 49(1)(b).  But the prosecution declined so to amend the indictment.

 
	The focus of our consideration has to be section 49(1)(a), which feeds into section 49(1)(b).  In our judgment the words of significance are the words "his proceeds of drug trafficking".  What the appellant says is that those words mean that in a case such as this, which was summed up to the jury on the basis that it was Mr Middleton who was trafficking the drugs, the sums derived from that trafficking could only be Mr Middleton's proceeds of drug trafficking and that therefore no charge could properly be laid against her in those circumstances: the only appropriate charge would be one under section 49(2).

 
	The respondent to the appeal says that the important words are "his proceeds", rather than (as could have been used by Parliament) "the proceeds of his drugs trafficking".  What the prosecution says is that, as in the facts of this case, where Mr Middleton sold drugs, the money derived from that became Ms Rourke's proceeds or their joint proceeds when they were either passed to her directly by the customer or by Mr Middleton, or were dealt with by them as part of a joint enterprise, where she, knowing what he was about, participated in and encouraged the general dealing with the proceeds of his drug trafficking.  In those circumstances, what is to be focused on is the ownership or the possession of the money derived from the drug trafficking, rather than the person who actually does the selling or the drug trafficking.

 
	The offence created by section 49(2) is concerned with some extraneous third party, such as an accountant or a solicitor, who is entirely unconnected with the drug trafficking, either as an individual or as part of a joint venture. 

 
	In our judgment this is a fine distinction, but it is nonetheless a real one and we agree with the respondent to the appeal that in the circumstances of this case, whilst it would no doubt have been open to them to have charged Ms Rourke under section 49(2), it was equally open to them to charge her as part of a joint enterprise under section 49(1)(b).  The directions of the judge, focusing as they did initially on Mr Middleton's alleged drug trafficking, but thereafter on what the Crown said was a joint enterprise involving both of them in dealing with the proceeds of that drug trafficking, directed the jury properly.  Therefore the conviction was not unsafe, being based on an appropriate charge for the facts which the jury found proved so that they were sure.

 
	For the reasons which we have given, therefore, we dismiss the appeals of each appellant against their convictions on each of counts 1 and 2 of the indictment.

 
	This appeal therefore fails.

 
	LORD JUSTICE LEVESON:  Thank you very much.

[

	MR JUSTICE WILKIE:  This is the appeal by John Middleton and Veronica Patricia Rourke, now aged 56 and 51 respectively, against certain convictions in the Crown Court at Truro on 13th February 2007.  They bring these appeals by leave of the single judge.

 
	They were each convicted on an amended indictment number T20060084 which contained three counts.  Count 1 charged them with converting the proceeds of drug trafficking, contrary to section 49(1)(b) of the Drug Trafficking Act 1994.  The particulars of the offence were that between 31st December 1999 and 24th February 2003 they converted property, namely money to the value of approximately £103,000, for the purpose of avoiding prosecution for a drug trafficking offence or the making of a confiscation order.

 
	Count 2 charged them with converting criminal property, contrary to section 327(1)(c) of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002.  The particulars of the offence were that between the 23rd day of February 2003 and the 29th day of June 2005 they converted criminal property to the value of approximately £70,000.

 
	Count 3 charged them with possession of criminal property, contrary to section 329(1)(c) of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002.  The particulars of that count were that on 28th June 2005 they had in their possession criminal property, namely £21,485 in cash.

 
	On 13th February 2007 the jury convicted them of each of counts 1, 2 and 3.  They appeal against the convictions only in respect of counts 1 and 2.

 
	Prior to that trial the appellant Middleton had pleaded guilty on separate occasions to counts of possession of a class C drug (cannabis) with intent to supply.

 
	Subsequent to their conviction, they were each in due course sentenced on counts 1, 2 and 3 on the present indictment, to sentences of 12 months on each concurrent.  The appellant Middleton was also sentenced in relation to the earlier two indictments and on each of the two counts of possession with intent to supply of cannabis, he received sentences of 30 months to run concurrently one with the other and concurrently with the sentences imposed in respect of counts 1 to 3.

 
	The facts leading to their convictions are as follows.  The appellants lived together with their children at an address, 10 Hawkins Road, Newquay.  They also owned a garage at Whitewalls in the town of Perrancoombe.  In June 2005 the police executed search warrants at their home address, resulting in seizure of 8.8 kilograms of cannabis resin, a set of digital scales, a list of names and figures and three quantities of cash: £975 found in clothing, £2,000 in an airing cupboard and £18,500 under the floorboards.  These were the matters in respect of which Mr Middleton pleaded guilty on 8th July 2005 to a charge of possession of a class C drug with intent to supply.  The money which was found on that occasion formed the subject matter of count 3 on the indictment with which we are concerned.

 
	On 5th September 2005 police officers executed a search warrant at the Whitewalls garage, there seizing 11.5 kilograms of cannabis resin being stored in tins concealed beneath some boarding in a cupboard.  The following words were written on one of the boards "Keep your fucking thieving hands off are [sic] I will batter you.  You know I fucking know how."  Middleton was charged with possession of that class C drug with intent to supply, and that is the matter to which he pleaded guilty to which we have already referred.

 
	The police conducted an investigation into the appellants' finances, resulting in a financial report referred to as "the Tracker".  The purpose of this document was to compare their known income with expenditure over the period 1999 to 2005.  That document was analysed by forensic accountants on behalf of each of the appellants and also on behalf of the Crown by Mr Frampton, who both reviewed the Tracker and commented upon the findings of the defence experts.

 
	At the trial the three accountants produced a joint statement setting out the areas upon which they had reached agreement.  They agreed that the Tracker's calculations were incorrect and that their differing figures, although using different accounting approaches, would probably be capable of reconciliation.  They were able to agree an "unexplained income" figure of £44,698 once all the appellants' known sources of income had been deducted from their total expenditure for the period 2000 to 2005.  The defence experts and their reports were not adduced in evidence before the jury, but Mr Frampton was called and his report relied on by the Crown.

 
	The prosecution case was that Middleton was involved in the commercial supply of cannabis and that he Rourke together laundered the profits.  They were alleged to have converted somewhere between £44,698 and £173,000 over a five-year period.  Count 1 concerned the period from December 1999 to February 2003, which was the period covered by the Drug Trafficking Act 1994.  It was said that up to £103,000 had been converted in that period.  Count 2 related to February 2003 to June 2005, a period covered by the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002.  It was alleged that up to £70,000 was converted during that period.  As we have indicated, count 3 concerned the cash found at the family home in June 2005 which exceeded £21,000, which it was said represented the proceeds of crime.

 
	The Crown accepted that the appellants had some legitimate income arising from caravan rentals and from Mr Middleton's self-employment, but it was the prosecution case that they had grossly inflated their legitimate income figures in order to account for the significant shortfall in relation to their expenditure.  The prosecution invited the jury to draw the inference that the source of the unexplained income was payments relating to drug trafficking, and that the seizures of cannabis from the appellants' properties demonstrated the nature and scale of the enterprise.

 
	The case of Middleton was that he was minding the cannabis for a friend and did not profit from the arrangement.  He denied being a drug dealer and denied being involved in the conversion of criminal proceeds.  He was self-employed and had had a number of different legitimate sources of income over the years, including building work, gardening and selling.  Any apparently unexplained income was due to the chaotic nature of his finances.

 
	The case of Rourke, with which Mr Middleton agreed, was that she had no knowledge of the cannabis found at their property and did not know or suspect that Middleton was involved with drugs.  She denied being involved in the conversion of the proceeds of crime and believed that all her income was from legitimate sources.  She accepted she may have failed to declare income to the Inland Revenue, but she had failed to keep proper financial records as an explanation for that.

 
	The evidence placed before the jury was as follows.  Detective Constable Mamaton gave evidence about the value of the drugs seized and gave evidence of her opinion that the drawings seized during the June 2005 searches were of a proposed hydroponics unit and that the list of names and figures seized was a dealer list, the figures on that list varying from between £20 to £6,000.

 
	Mr Frampton, the forensic accountant, gave evidence of his detailed analysis of the couple's finances.  He took the view that because of lack of information in relation to 1999, figures for that year should be ignored.  He gave evidence supporting his figure of an unexplained income between 2000 and 2005 of the sum of £44,000-odd, to which we have already referred.

 
	Paul Hoyte, from Trenance Holiday Park, gave evidence as to how that business worked and the profits that could be made.  He confirmed that the appellants owned several caravans at this holiday park which were let out.  They paid him ground rent and could expect to make around £450 per caravan per week in high season.

 
	Phillip Francis, a Customs officer, gave evidence that on 11th February 2005 Mr Middleton was stopped at Bristol airport as he was about to board a flight to Spain.  He was carrying just under £10,000 in cash.  When questioned, he told the officer that the money was intended to be used as a deposit on a property in Spain.

 
	John Lobb gave evidence of Mr Middleton's claim to have earned money in the late 1990s by clearing out a restaurant called the Clock Tower which had suffered a fire, and that he had sold Mr Lobb the restaurant chairs.  He confirmed that he had bought 30 to 40 chairs from the burnt-out restaurant, but this was in mid-1990s and he paid £5 to £6 for each.

 
	Janice Cobley of the Ambassador Hotel gave evidence concerning Mr Middleton's claim to have earned cash from carrying out roofing repairs at the Hotel.  She stated that she had no record of Mr Middleton having carried out any such work, and in any event she never paid workmen in cash.

 
	Malcolm Pelmear gave evidence in relation to Mr Middleton's claim to have carried out roofing work at Newquay railway station.  Mr Pelmear was employed by Network Rail, was involved in the management of the station and said he could find no record of Mr Middleton having carried out any such work.

 
	Evidence was given of the interviews conducted with the appellants.  Each had denied being involved in drug dealing or money laundering.  They made no comment to some of the questions asked.  Mr Middleton handed a prepared statement which said that he would be able to answer all allegations in due course by explaining all the legitimate sources of his earnings.  He was asked about the list of names that had been seized from his house and said that he knew nothing about it.  He was asked about the writing on the boards at the Whitewalls garage and said he was not responsible for that.  When asked about the drawings, he said he had not seen them before.

 
	Mr Middleton gave evidence about what he said were his legitimate business interests.  He said that because of the chaotic nature of their finances, he and Rourke may have significantly underestimated their earnings for the indictment period.  He said that he always worked: he had been a salesman, worked in the building trade and in factories, and he had done landscape gardening and rubbish clearance.  He admitted that he withheld information about his income from the Inland Revenue and that he kept no proper record of his earnings.  He said in the late 1990s, following a fire at the Clock Tower restaurant, he earned £10,000 from clearing the premises and selling the chairs to Mr Lobb.  He had inherited money from a relative, which accounted for the £20,000 in the safe found by the police in June 2005.  He said that he and Rourke earned a good income from the caravan rentals and from property in Spain.

 
	With regard to the money he made from his own work, he would often be paid in cash and would put it away in various places around the house without the knowledge of Rourke, which explained the cash that was found by police during their searches.  He denied that any of his money came from drug dealing, but he said that because of the lack of written records it was difficult to remember details of jobs he had done five or six years previously.

 
	As far as the cannabis was concerned, he said he was doing some work with a friend one day at the garage at Whitewalls when another friend appeared and asked whether he could hide his drugs there.  Middleton agreed and gave this friend a key to the premises.  Later that day the friend turned up at his home address and asked him to look after some more cannabis which was stored in tins.  He thought this was some time during the week prior to 28th June 2005.  That was how he came to be in possession of some 20 kilograms of cannabis.  He was minding it for this friend.

 
	One day he noticed that some of the cannabis at the garage had gone missing, and he suspected the other friend who had been helping him to have taken it.  That was why he wrote the warning words on the walls.  He admitted lying about that writing in interview because he thought it would incriminate him.  In relation to the list of names and figures, he admitted that it was writing but stated that it was simply jobs that he had priced.  When asked why he had lied in interview, he said he had not told the police the whole truth because he had felt that his income was none of their business.

 
	Ms Rourke gave evidence that she had no knowledge of the drugs found by police and that Mr Middleton would not have told her that he was hiding them for a friend because he would have known that she would have disapproved.  She was not involved in or aware of drug dealing and believed all the family income was legitimately earned.  Their caravan rental business was a cash business.  She used the cash for day-to-day expenses rather than banking it.  With five caravans she could earn about £35,000 to £44,000 a year.  She conceded she had made inaccurate returns to the Inland Revenue and that she in fact earned more from the business than she has suggested in interview.  She and Mr Middleton did not keep proper business records.  She was aware that Mr Middleton used to keep cash around the house, but did not ask him about it.  They were largely financially independent of one another.  The property they had bought in Spain was funded partly from the caravan rental profits and partly by a loan.

 
	At the outset of the trial on 29th January 2007 the appellants sought to have counts 1 and 2 quashed on the basis that they were bad for duplicity.  The argument was that there were identifiable transactions throughout the period covered by these counts which could and should have been individually isolated to allege specific acts of money laundering or conversion of criminal property.  The judge, in ruling against the appellants, acknowledged that, by way of analogy with charges under the Theft Act, it is only in very limited circumstances that it is possible for the prosecution to charge rolled-up or general deficiency counts.  Otherwise the Crown must specify, if need be by way of specimen counts rather than citing every single transaction, individual instances of theft, so as to reflect the criminality charged.  However, the judge concluded that the legislation under which these offences were being charged, in his judgment, permitted the prosecution to conduct the case in the way that it had and that there was nothing in the legislation itself which precluded such an approach, though he indicated that he would keep a weather eye on the way the case developed. 

 
	At the conclusion of the evidence, counsel for Middleton invited the judge to indicate how he intended to direct the jury of the minimum sum of which they had to be satisfied before they could convict his client on count 1 and/or count 2.  The judge indicated that he was not prepared to contemplate leaving the case for the jury on the basis that "approximately" in the indictment might mean anything upwards of the £44,698 which comprised the so-called unexplained income.  This would mean that, even if the jury were to accept that the defence case in respect of their respective legitimate incomes may be to any extent right, they would nonetheless still face conviction on these counts.

 
	Immediately before the defence closing speeches, the judge indicated that he would direct the jury to the effect that "approximately" meant "within 20% of the figure indicated".  The judge directed the jury in the following terms:

 
"The Prosecution say that the maximum amount of overspend, approximately, that they simply cannot account [for] is £173,000 - £103,000 in the first count and £70,000 in the second.  There is also a minimum bottom line of £44,698.  But the Prosecution have chosen to allege the counts in the way that they have.  They have freedom to make the allegations within the law in whatever way they like and they have chosen to say 'approximately £103,000' and 'approximately £70,000' respectively Counts 1 and 2.  And they have not put a bracket on it, they have just used that expression 'approximately' so that is what they must prove.
But 'approximately' must mean something and I direct you that unless you are sure that the Prosecution have got within 20% of those figures, then you should not convict, assuming you find all the rest of the necessary ingredients proved.  So, in rough terms, and use these figures because they are approximately 20%, unless you are sure in Count 1 that it has been proved that criminal money, drugs money, of £80,000 or more, up to a maximum of £103,000, or in the case of Count 2, £55,000 up to a maximum of £70,000, you may not convict, but within that bracket the Prosecution can succeed."
	The case at trial for both the prosecution and the defence focused on three major elements, within each of which there were subsidiary issues of fact.  The first element was "unexplained other income".  That comprised a series of figures, from 2000 through to 2005, which the forensic accountants agreed could not be explained as income from any source at all.  That sum totalled £44,698.  Had the Crown not been able to prove anything beyond that figure then, in accordance with the judge's direction to the jury, there could not have been a conviction on either count 1 or count 2.

 
	The second element was the income which Mr Middleton asserted he derived from legitimate self-employment of various types.  That figure was identified for each of the years 2000 to 2005.  It totalled £83,500.  In accordance with the judge's direction, if the jury had been satisfied so that they were sure that none of Mr Middleton's claimed legitimate income was legitimate income and they were also satisfied that the "unexplained other income" came from drug money, then, nonetheless, the prosecution would not have succeeded in reaching the more than 80% mark.  Thus there could not be a conviction on either counts 1 or 2.

 
	The third element constituted the income of the appellant Rourke.  She claimed that the entirety of her income derived from renting a number of caravans at the Trenance Holiday Park which she owned.  The Crown's case was that it accepted that to some extent she did derive legitimate income from that business.  Their case was that it was limited to those payments which were paid into her bank account direct from her tenants.  There was, in respect of each of the years 2000 to 2005, a balance which represented unbanked income.  The Crown said that none of that balance derived from that legitimate business but it derived from drug dealing money.  The Crown was able, through the analysis of bank accounts, to identify how much that "unbanked" income of Rourke was in each of the years 2000 to 2005.  Again, had the jury been satisfied so that they were sure that the Crown had satisfied them that none of that money was legitimate, then, even if they were sure that one or other of the other elements was proved, they would not convict of either of counts 1 or 2 because the more than 80% test had not been satisfied.

 
	Thus, the effect of the judge's direction to the jury was that they could only convict either appellant of either counts 1 or 2 if they were satisfied so that they were sure that income from each of the three elements was not legitimate but derived from drug dealing money and were sure of sufficient in each of the three categories such that at least 80% of their unexplained or dubiously explained income derived from drug dealing.

 
	The appellants accept that this direction went a long way towards safeguarding them from the risk that they might be convicted of significant money laundering offences, where the jury were only satisfied of a relatively small portion of the sums alleged by the Crown.  They say, however, that the decision of the judge to permit the Crown to proceed on counts 1 and 2, drafted in that general way, was wrong as a matter of principle and not saved by his specific direction to the jury.

 
The law 
	The Indictment Rules 1971 have been revoked by the Criminal Procedure (Amendment) Rules 2007 which (by Rule 9) inserted a new Part 14 in the 2005 Criminal Procedure Rules to make fresh provision as to the form, content, signature and service of indictments.  Rule 14.2 of the 2005 Rules (as amended) concern the form and content of indictment.  They read, insofar as is relevant, as follows:

 
"14.2(1).  An indictment must be in one of the forms set out in the Practice Direction and must contain, in a paragraph called a 'count' -
 (a) a statement of the offence charged ... 
 (b) such particulars of the conduct constituting the commission of the offence as to make clear what the prosecutor alleges against the defendant.
 (2) More than one incident of the commission of the offence may be included in a count if those incidents taken together amount to a course of conduct having regard to the time, place or purpose of commission."
	Practice direction (Criminal Proceedings: Consolidation) paragraphs IV.34.8 to IV.34.12, as inserted by the Practice Direction (Criminal Proceedings: Further Directions) [2007] 1 WLR 1790, states, insofar as is relevant, as follows:

 
"IV.34.8.  Rule 14.2(2) of the Criminal Procedure Rules 2005 allows a single count to allege more than one incident of the commission of an offence in certain circumstances.  Each incident must be of the same offence.  The circumstances in which such a count may be appropriate include, but are not limited to, the following:
 (a) the victim on each occasion was the same, or there was no identifiable individual victim as, for example, in a case of the unlawful importation of controlled drugs or of money laundering;
 (b) the alleged incidents involved a marked degree of repetition in the method employed or in their location, or both;
 (c) the alleged incidents took place over a clearly defined period, typically (but not necessarily) no more than about a year;
 (d) in any event, the defence is such as to apply to every alleged incident without differentiation.  Where what is in issue differs between different incidents, a single 'multiple incidents' count will not be appropriate, though it may be appropriate to use two or more such counts according to the circumstances and to the issues raised by the defence.  ...
IV.34.11.  In some cases, such as money laundering or theft, there will be documented evidence of individual incidents but the sheer number of these will make it desirable to cover them in a single count.  Where the indictment contains a count alleging multiple incidents of the commission of such offences, and during the course of the trial it becomes clear that the jury may bring in a verdict in relation to a lesser amount than that alleged by the prosecution, it will normally be desirable to direct the jury that they should return a partial verdict with reference to that lesser amount."
	The explanatory memorandum to the Practice Direction states that the Criminal Procedure Rule Committee was "satisfied that the new rule reflects what judgments of the House of Lords in the past have found consistent with fundamental principles of fairness." 

 
	The trial in this case was not governed by the 2007 amendment to the Criminal Procedure Rules 2005.  We note, however, that the Criminal Procedure Rules Committee considered that they were doing no more than codifying the existing law in formulating Rule 14.2(2) and giving guidance in Practice Direction IV.34.8 and IV.34.11.  The learned editors of Archbold surmise, in our judgment correctly, that the Committee had in mind in that regard the speech of Lord Diplock in Director of Public Prosecutions v Merriman [1973] AC 584 HL at 607 at which he said at letter C:

 
"The rule against duplicity, viz. that only one offence should be charged in any count of an indictment,  ... has always been applied in a practical, rather than in a strictly analytical, way for the purpose of determining what constituted one offence.  Where a number of acts of a similar nature committed by one or more defendants were connected with one another, in the time and place of their commission or by their common purpose, in such a way that they could fairly be regarded as forming part of the same transaction or criminal enterprise, it was the practice, as early as the eighteenth century, to charge them in a single count of an indictment."
	The most recent description of this practice and its justification is to be found in the judgment of the Divisional Court in Barton v Director of Public Prosecutions [2001] EWHC Admin 223, in which at paragraph 6 Kennedy LJ said:

 
"... where the individual transactions are known but where there are many transactions of the same type, frequently individually of small value, against the same victim, and it is convenient in order to reflect the overall criminality to put them together in one information, or one count, so that if the criminality can be proved, without prejudice to the defendant and having regard to the known defence, then the court will be in a position to sentence appropriately."
	And at paragraphs 22 to 23:

 
"22.  ...  Specimen counts or specimen informations are no longer a possibility, in the light of relatively recent decisions of this Court and of the Court of Appeal Criminal Division.  To have 94 separate informations would have rightly been regarded as oppressive. ...
23.  ... This is not a case where she had put forward a specific answer to some of the alleged takings and not to others, and that then specific answers needed to be considered separately.  ...  The Magistrate was able to, and did in fact, give credit for the amount that he was not satisfied had been taken.  So far as I can ascertain there was no discernible prejudice or unfairness to the appellant in regarding this as a continuous offence within the principles set out in the authorities to which I have referred."
The appellants' submissions 
	Mr Middleton accepts that the number of discrete offences, based on each individual transaction which was identifiable, would have involved preparing and incorporating a schedule running to many of hundreds, indeed thousands, of entries because it was the Crown's case that every financial transaction which Mr Middleton had effected over the period of the indictment was a conversion of the proceeds of drug trafficking.  It is contended that what the Crown could and should have done was to charge a small number of these credits, year by year, as specimen or sample counts.  The appellant has identified in a schedule, setting out two counts per year, 12 individual banking transactions the value of which totals under £10,000.  In addition, in relation to the numerous secondary transactions, where the Crown have asserted that goods paid for by cash, cheque or credit card transactions constituted fresh acts of conversion, he has identified, by way of specimen counts, a further 11 totalling about £45,000.  Furthermore, the appellant has identified four large purchases, of value just over £100,000, of various properties said to involve conversion.

 
	In that way it is said that it was practicable for the Crown to identify discrete offences sufficiently few in number to have been accommodated by the jury, but reflecting the overall scale of the criminality.

 
	It is said that the unfairness of the Crown's approach meant that he could potentially have faced conviction, whether or not the jury concluded that he had been dealing in drugs throughout the period or whether they only concluded that he had so dealt for some lesser period, and it was pointed out that the evidence of drug dealing was much more convincing in relation to the latter period rather than in the earlier years.  The jury was not in a position, by its verdicts, to reveal such a decision.  It is accepted that the judge's intervention, by the direction to which we have referred, mitigated very substantially this intrinsic unfairness.  The point of principle, however, remains that, wherever possible, individual charges ought to be formulated in respect of individual transactions or events, so that the defendants know precisely the charge they face and have a fair opportunity of adducing focused evidence to meet the charge concerned.  General deficiency counts ought, it is submitted, to be strictly confined to circumstances where it is genuinely impossible for the Crown to formulate specific counts, including, if need be, sample counts which are adequate to allow a jury to decide about the overall wrongdoing alleged.

 
	The appellant Rourke adopts these submissions.

 
The Crown's submissions 
	The Crown's submissions are that the prosecution case was that Mr Middleton was a drug trafficker.  They rejected his assertion that he was minding drugs for another on the occasions when they were found in his possession.  They alleged he had been involved in the supply of drugs for a number of years, though there was no direct evidence of previous incidents of supply.  They relied upon an analysis of the financial position of the appellants between 2000 and 2005 to support that assertion.  Counts 1 and 2 involved the application of the principle of general deficiency which was both necessary and fair.

 
	It is said that the description of the circumstances in which a general deficiency would be available in Merriman is satisfied.  The analysis of the three known sources of income of Mr Middleton and Ms Rourke which underpinned counts 1 and 2 required the jury to focus on the three areas which we have identified.  In respect of each, it was said the Crown was unable to identify individual transactions as involving the conversion of criminal property because the Crown accepted that the appellants had been in receipt of some legitimate income, albeit limited in amount.  Thus the prosecution could not allege that individual cash credits, or identified specific purchases, constituted acts of conversion so as appropriately to be charged as discrete charges.  This was not a case where, for example, the prosecution was able to point, in evidence, to any particular event which took place immediately prior to a particular transaction so as to give rise to an inference that such transaction was connected with the supply of drugs.

 
	On the issue of fairness, the Crown relies on the direction given by the judge that before the jury could properly convict either appellant they had to be sure that they had converted at least 80% of the sum alleged in the individual count.  That would, of necessity, mean that the jury, before convicting, would have to be sure that for at least five of the six years between 2000 and 2005 the appellants were converting the proceeds of drug trafficking to the scale suggested by the Crown and that the jury rejected the innocent explanations given by the appellants in respect of each of the three categories of income.  It was unavoidable, say the Crown, that the figures set out in the indictment were imprecise because the prosecution was unable to apportion a specific figure for the legitimate work which the appellants had carried out.

 
Our conclusions 
	In our judgment the prosecution is correct in its submissions.  The prosecution case was that each of the appellants had been involved in a course of conduct, drug dealing (Mr Middleton) and (both appellants) converting the proceeds of such dealing over a number of years.  They had done so in a huge number of individual transactions, mostly small in scale.  Intermingled with that illegal activity, the prosecution accepted, was some legitimate activity on the part of each of the appellants.  It was impossible to untangle that activity, save that, in the case of Ms Rourke, the prosecution asserted that there was a distinction to be drawn between the direct banking of income from customers of her legitimate activity and banking of cash by her arising out of Middleton's drug trafficking.

 
	It would have been unduly oppressive and onerous to have identified each and every individual transaction as separate counts.  Furthermore, to have adopted a relatively small number of discrete specimen counts would have given rise to two problems.  First, even if convicted, the powers of the judge in sentencing would have been constrained by authority so as to be limited to those specimen counts which had been proved.  Second, in any event, the prosecution was unable to say, of any individual transaction, that the jury could be sure that the money involved derived from drug trafficking.  It was the scale of the informal transactions, and the paucity and untruthfulness of the evidence from the appellants to justify that level of economic activity as legitimate, which was the essence of the Crown's case.

 
	In our judgment, therefore, it was legitimate for the Crown to proceed with counts alleging general deficiency.  They chose to do so by two counts only, each covering a number of years and separated only by reference to the different statutory regimes which applied at different times.  In our judgment this was a high risk strategy and, on its own, might have given rise to unfairness.  The point is well made by the appellants that, by not dividing the period into individual years, by way of example, the Crown was inviting the jury to consider activity over two lengthy periods, rather than what may still have been significant, but lesser, periods within the overall time frame.  Without any mediation, this might have led to convictions by the jury for criminality significantly less serious than alleged by the Crown but of which the judge in sentencing would have been unaware.  However, the judge, in a sensible approach to managing the case for the benefit of the jury and the appellants, by his direction ensured that convictions on each of counts 1 and 2 would reflect that the jury was sure that the appellants were guilty of the criminal activity alleged and on the scale alleged.

 
	In our judgment, therefore, neither count 1 nor count 2 was unlawfully duplicitous in itself.  They involved a continuing activity, or general deficiency, falling within the authorities, nor, in the event, did they give rise to unfairness.  In those circumstances, in respect of these arguments, the verdicts of the jury were not unsafe.

 
Ms Rourke's separate point 
	The appellant Ms Rourke raises an additional point.  She says she could not, in law, be guilty of count 1.  This count charges her, under section 49(1)(b) of the 1994 Drug Trafficking Act, with converting property "for the purpose of avoiding prosecution for a drug trafficking offence or the making of a confiscation order."  It is said that, as she has never been charged in respect of a drug trafficking offence nor been convicted of one, she could not be the subject of such a charge as she could not act for the prohibited purpose as she was neither threatened with prosecution nor, after conviction, the making of a confiscation order.

 
	It is said that the judge erred in law in directing the jury that the prosecution could establish her guilt if she was acting together with her husband for the purpose of avoiding his prosecution as a drug trafficker or the making of a confiscation order in the event of his conviction as such.

 
	Section 49 of the Drug Trafficking Act 1994 reads, insofar as is relevant, as follows:

 
"(1) A person is guilty of an offence if he  
 (a) conceals or disguises any property which is, or in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents, his proceeds of drug trafficking, or 
 (b) converts or transfers that property or removes it from the jurisdiction,
for the purpose of avoiding prosecution for a drug trafficking offence or the making or enforcement in his case of a confiscation order.
 (2) A person is guilty of an offence if, knowing or having reasonable grounds to suspect that any property is, or in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents, another person's proceeds of drug trafficking, he  
 (a) conceals or disguises that property, or 
 (b) converts or transfers that property or removes it from the jurisdiction,
for the purpose of assisting any person to avoid prosecution for a drug trafficking offence or the making or enforcement of a confiscation order."
	Ms Rourke says that the appropriate offence to have charged her with on the facts of this case was an offence under section 49(2).  Indeed, it is the case that at the conclusion of the prosecution case submissions were made to the effect that that was the appropriate charge, rather than a charge under section 49(1)(b).  But the prosecution declined so to amend the indictment.

 
	The focus of our consideration has to be section 49(1)(a), which feeds into section 49(1)(b).  In our judgment the words of significance are the words "his proceeds of drug trafficking".  What the appellant says is that those words mean that in a case such as this, which was summed up to the jury on the basis that it was Mr Middleton who was trafficking the drugs, the sums derived from that trafficking could only be Mr Middleton's proceeds of drug trafficking and that therefore no charge could properly be laid against her in those circumstances: the only appropriate charge would be one under section 49(2).

 
	The respondent to the appeal says that the important words are "his proceeds", rather than (as could have been used by Parliament) "the proceeds of his drugs trafficking".  What the prosecution says is that, as in the facts of this case, where Mr Middleton sold drugs, the money derived from that became Ms Rourke's proceeds or their joint proceeds when they were either passed to her directly by the customer or by Mr Middleton, or were dealt with by them as part of a joint enterprise, where she, knowing what he was about, participated in and encouraged the general dealing with the proceeds of his drug trafficking.  In those circumstances, what is to be focused on is the ownership or the possession of the money derived from the drug trafficking, rather than the person who actually does the selling or the drug trafficking.

 
	The offence created by section 49(2) is concerned with some extraneous third party, such as an accountant or a solicitor, who is entirely unconnected with the drug trafficking, either as an individual or as part of a joint venture. 

 
	In our judgment this is a fine distinction, but it is nonetheless a real one and we agree with the respondent to the appeal that in the circumstances of this case, whilst it would no doubt have been open to them to have charged Ms Rourke under section 49(2), it was equally open to them to charge her as part of a joint enterprise under section 49(1)(b).  The directions of the judge, focusing as they did initially on Mr Middleton's alleged drug trafficking, but thereafter on what the Crown said was a joint enterprise involving both of them in dealing with the proceeds of that drug trafficking, directed the jury properly.  Therefore the conviction was not unsafe, being based on an appropriate charge for the facts which the jury found proved so that they were sure.

 
	For the reasons which we have given, therefore, we dismiss the appeals of each appellant against their convictions on each of counts 1 and 2 of the indictment.

 
	This appeal therefore fails.

 
	LORD JUSTICE LEVESON:  Thank you very much.

Lord Justice Laws:
INTRODUCTORY

This is a prosecutor's appeal pursuant to s.58 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, brought with leave of the judge below, against a terminating ruling made on 27 April 2007 at the Bournemouth Crown Court.  The ruling consisted in the decision of His Honour Judge Wiggs, the trial judge, to accede to a submission of no case to answer advanced on behalf of all four defendants in the trial proceeding before him.  The defendants faced an indictment containing 33 counts of what in shorthand may be called money laundering.  There were three statutory offences charged.  Counts 1, 2 and 11 charged offences of entering into an agreement to acquire, retain, use, or control criminal property contrary to s.328 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 ("POCA").  Counts 3, 5, 7, 9, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30 and 32 alleged 15 offences of transferring criminal property contrary to s.327 of  POCA.  Counts 4, 6, 8, 10, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, 31 and 33 alleged 15 offences of removing criminal property from England and Wales to Jamaica also contrary to s.327.  Ss.327 and 328 appear in Part 7 of the Act (cross-headed "Money Laundering").

 
The overall period covered by the indictment was 1 July 2003 - 3 July 2005, though individual offences were said to have been committed over shorter periods within the overall span.

 
As we have indicated there were four defendants.  The Crown's case was that the prime mover was the defendant NW.  Something over £105,000 was transferred out of the UK to Jamaica.  The Crown alleged that all of it represented the proceeds of criminal conduct in which NW was involved.  The other three defendants were related to or associated with NW.  Each of counts 1, 2 and 11 alleged an agreement contrary to s.328 between NW and one of the other defendants, in effect to carry out the transactions charged in the two groups of offences contrary to s.327:  first, the transfer of money from NW to the three others, and secondly the removal of the money by those three from the UK to Jamaica.  

 
The total sum said to have been the subject of the arrangements charged at counts 1, 2 and 11 was £105,198.  The sum involved in the first set of s.327 charges  transfer by NW to the other 3  was £32,999:  and the sum involved in the second set  removal from the UK to Jamaica  was also £32,999.  It was of course the same money.  This figure differs from that involved in counts 1, 2 and 11 because the s.327 counts were specimen charges.

 
In order to bring home any or all of these offences the Crown had to prove that the funds involved constituted "criminal property" within the meaning of POCA s.340, which also defines "criminal conduct" for the purpose of these statutory offences.  S.340 provides in part as follows:

 
"(2)	Criminal conduct is conduct which 
(a) constitutes an offence in any part of the United Kingdom, or 
(b) would constitute an offence in any part of the United Kingdom if it occurred there.
(3)	       Property is criminal property if 
(a) it constitutes a person's benefit from criminal conduct or it represents such a benefit (in whole or in part and whether directly or indirectly), and	  
(b) the alleged offender knows or suspects that it constitutes such a benefit.
(4)	It is immaterial  
	                    (a)  who carried out the conduct;
				(b)  who benefited from it.
(5)		A person benefits from conduct if he obtains property as a result of or in connection with the conduct."
It will be necessary to consider certain other provisions, contained in Part 5 of POCA, when we come to review the relevant authorities, but it will be convenient to set those out at that stage.
The essence of the issue in this appeal may be put shortly.  To establish  guilt under s.327 or s.328, must the Crown prove what particular criminal conduct, or at least what type of criminal conduct, has generated the benefit which the alleged criminal property represents?  Or is it enough if they can show, no doubt by reference to the large sums involved and the defendants' want of any apparent means of substance (as well as any other relevant evidence), that the money in question can have had no lawful origin  even if they have no evidence of  the crime or class of crime involved?  The Crown say the latter suffices.  In his terminating ruling the learned trial judge held that it did not.  He granted leave to appeal on these grounds:

 
"1	 [T]he learned judge erred in ruling at the close of the Crown's case that the defendants had no case to answer because the monies they allegedly transferred to Jamaica could not be criminal property as the prosecution had no evidence of specific criminal conduct, or even a particular type of conduct, on the part of any defendant, so that all the prosecution could say is that those monies had no lawful origin.
2	[T]he learned judge erred in ruling that the circumstances surrounding the origin of the monies transferred created a reverse burden of proof for the defendants to overcome.
There is a real prospect of success in this appeal.  
This is an important area of law which needs to be clarified."
On granting leave to appeal the learned judge made no provision for the appeal to be expedited, and discharged the jury.
THE PROSECUTION EVIDENCE
Since the appeal raises a pure question of law it is unnecessary to canvass the facts to any great extent beyond the bare summary we have already given.   The Crown claimed to have evidence tending to prove the arrangements between NW and the others, the transfers from NW to the others, and the removals by the others of the funds to Jamaica.  The removals were effected through Western Union or Jamaica National Overseas Ltd.  The Crown also claimed to have the names of the recipients in Jamaica.  These facts were by no means all agreed or admitted, indeed some were or would be hotly contested; but the Crown say that there was at least enough evidence upon which a reasonable jury might find the facts alleged.  

 
The Crown was also able to establish, or so it claimed, that NW had no visible means of support.  He had arrived in the United Kingdom on 3 September 2001.  His passport was held by the Immigration Service throughout the period covered by the indictment.  The Department of Work and Pensions had no record of benefits paid to him since his arrival in this country and Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs had no trace of any tax records relating to him.  SW and RC were in receipt of state benefits throughout the period of the indictment.  CC is the daughter of RC and the mother of NW's child.  There are no tax records for her, or RC.  Over £5,000 cash was found at RC's home on 3 August 2005.  There was evidence of very frequent phone calls between the defendants.  

 
All that said, it is clear that the Crown were in no position to prove any particular criminal activity, or type of criminal activity, perpetrated by NW or anyone else. 

 
THE TERMINATING RULING
It is important to appreciate that the submissions of no case to answer with which the learned judge below had to deal fell into two distinct parts.  There was first an overarching submission for all the defendants to the effect that the Crown were required to allege and prove at least the type of criminal activity said to constitute the relevant "criminal conduct" within the meaning of POCA s.340(2).  Secondly, there was a series of distinct submissions to the effect that in any event there was insufficient evidence, as against each defendant, to justify the case going further.  The judge ruled in favour of the defence on the first issue and so did not rule on the second.  

 
This appeal is accordingly limited to the pure question of law which we have already identified, arising out of the judge's ruling on the first issue: must the Crown prove what particular criminal conduct, or at least what type of criminal conduct, has generated the benefit which the alleged criminal property represents?  The judge's reasoning concludes as follows (transcript of ruling 14E):

 
"The difference between this case and the case of IK [to which we shall return in due course] is that in that case there was evidence of dishonest conduct.  In this case, all the prosecution can say is that the money has no lawful origin and, in my estimation, that does reverse the burden of proof upon these defendants, and, as that is not a proper way to leave a case to a jury, I decide on the facts of this case on the Crown case as presented to me and presented to this jury that there is no case to answer."
THE APPELLANT'S ARGUMENT
The appellant's argument is simple enough to state.  It is that in order to establish guilt under POCA s.327 or s.328 the Crown must prove that the defendant had dealt with what he knew or suspected was criminal property, that is (see s.340) property which constitutes or represents a person's benefit from conduct which constitutes an offence in any part of the United Kingdom  but that is all: s.340 contains no provision to the effect that property can only be shown to be criminal property if the prosecution can identify, or at least categorise, the criminal conduct behind it.  Nor is any such requirement to be found in any general rule of evidence, whether given by statute or the common law.  

 
In those circumstances Mr Bartlett for the Crown submits that if the prosecution proves primary facts from which a reasonable jury applying the criminal standard of proof may infer that the property in question must have been the fruits of a criminal offence or offences by some person (and the defendant knew or suspected that that was so), then the offence charged, whether under s.327 or s.328, is made out.  There is no reason in law or in logic to conclude that the circumstances in which such an inference may be drawn are limited to cases where the prosecution can identify the particular offence or type of offence committed.  

 
THE RESPONDENTS' ARGUMENT
The respondent defendants' argument may be encapsulated in two propositions.  (1) The Crown's submission involves a reversal of the burden of proof, and the judge was right to reject it on that ground.  (2)  On the proper construction of POCA s.340 the Crown are required to prove at least the type or class of crime which has generated the benefit which the alleged criminal property represents.  To confront this second proposition will require some examination of authority.

 
BURDEN OF PROOF
In our judgment the respondents' first argument confuses a reversal of the burden of proof, which would of course be illegitimate, with a different proposition, namely that unless the Crown can identify the crime or class of crime in question, no inference of guilt can as a matter of fact be drawn.  It is notable that the written submissions of no case put before the judge by (at least) NW and SW (and relied on before us) develop detailed arguments to the effect that the evidence against them is as consistent with an innocent explanation of the transferred cash as with its being the proceeds of crime.  Whether or not that is right no doubt depends on the outcome of the second area of argument advanced before the judge at the close of the Crown case  that is, the submissions for each defendant to the effect that in any event there was insufficient evidence to justify the case going further.  As we have indicated the judge did not have to, and did not, deal with that because he ruled in favour of the defence on their first overarching submission to the effect that in principle the Crown had to prove at least the type of criminal activity said to constitute the relevant "criminal conduct".

 
We did not understand the respondents to submit that there could never be a case in which the Crown might properly invite the jury to infer from the available facts that criminal activity was the only reasonable and non-fanciful explanation for the presence of the relevant property in the hands of the defendants, even though there was nothing to show what class of crime was involved.  We would in any event reject so general and unqualified a proposition.  Everything, of course, depends on the particular facts.  The protection for defendants is that such an inference can only properly be drawn if it meets the criminal standard of proof, and the jury must of course be so directed.  

 
Accordingly there may be cases (whether or not this is one) in which guilt under POCA s.327 or 328 could be inferred, applying the criminal standard, without proof of the class of crime in question.  Whether a prosecution in such a case is lawfully and properly brought depends in our judgment on the correctness or otherwise of the respondents' second argument, namely that on the correct construction of POCA s.340 the Crown are required to prove at least the type or class of crime in question, to which we will come in due course.  

 
However the respondents' first argument, that allowing such convictions would sanction an illegitimate reversal of the burden of proof, is in our view without substance.  Such cases merely take their place among a multitude of other instances in which the prosecution's force depends on circumstantial evidence, and therefore inference.  The argument proves too much: it would mean that every case where guilt is established by a critical inference from circumstance is vitiated by reversal of the burden of proof.  There is no such reversal of the burden of proof.  There is only a particular, and perfectly legitimate, mode of proof: inference from circumstance.  At paragraph 3.3 of her written submission of no case the defendant SW pertinently cites paragraph 10-3 of the 2007 edition of Archbold:

 
"Circumstantial evidence is receivable in criminal as well as in civil cases; and, indeed, the necessity of admitting such evidence is more obvious in the former than the latter; for, in criminal cases, the possibility of proving the matter charged by the direct and positive testimony of eye-witnesses or by conclusive documents is much more rare than in civil cases; and where such testimony is not available, the jury are permitted to infer from the facts proved other facts necessary to complete the elements of guilt or establish innocence.  'It must always be narrowly examined, if only because evidence of this kind may be fabricated to cast suspicion on another...  It is also necessary before drawing the inference of the accused's guilt from circumstantial evidence to be sure that there are no other co-existing circumstances which would weaken or destroy the inference' per Lord Normand in Teper v R [1952] AC 480 at 489 (PC)."
The citation from Lord Normand is an apt reminder that the inference which the jury are invited to draw must pass muster by the criminal standard of proof.
No doubt, if such an inference is prima facie there to be drawn, an evidential burden is cast on the defendant to show that after all the inference is wrong:  there is another explanation for the defendant's dealing with the property.  But it is surely commonplace that the presence of such an evidential burden does not reposition the legal burden of proof.  In the terminating ruling the learned judge cited an observation of Moses J, as he then was, in Muneka v CCE [2005] EWHC Admin 495 at paragraph 13:

 
"I should say for the sake of clarity that in answer to the question in relation to the reverse burden of proof, although it was not argued before me, it is plain that there was no reverse burden of proof properly so called.  All that happened on the facts was that the facts were so startling that they called for an explanation.  No truthful explanation was given.  That does not amount to a shift of any burden of proof."
Beyond Moses J's dictum in Muneka there is, so far as we are aware, no authority which casts particular light on this argument regarding the burden of proof.  Loizou [2005] 2 CAR 618, [2006] EWCA Crim 1719, supports the proposition that it is open to the Crown to prove that relevant funds had become criminal property by inference (see per Clarke LJ as he then was at paragraph 14); but this with respect goes no distance for our purposes, since Clarke LJ's observations give no indication whether the facts to be proved must include the type of crime committed and there is no discussion of any issue relating to the reversal of the burden of proof.   

 
We conclude, for the reasons we have given, that the judge was wrong to characterise the Crown's position as involving any reversal of the burden of proof.  We turn to the respondents' second submission.

 
THE TRUE CONSTRUCTION OF POCA S.340  THE AUTHORITIES REVIEWED
As Mr Bartlett submitted, what has to be proved in order to establish guilt under POCA s.327 or s.328 is that the defendant had dealt with what he knew or suspected was criminal property, that is (see s.340(3)) property which constitutes or represents a person's benefit from conduct which constitutes an offence in any part of the United Kingdom.  Does that import a requirement to prove the particular offence, or class of offence, said to have been committed? ]

Lord Justice Laws:
INTRODUCTORY

This is a prosecutor's appeal pursuant to s.58 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, brought with leave of the judge below, against a terminating ruling made on 27 April 2007 at the Bournemouth Crown Court.  The ruling consisted in the decision of His Honour Judge Wiggs, the trial judge, to accede to a submission of no case to answer advanced on behalf of all four defendants in the trial proceeding before him.  The defendants faced an indictment containing 33 counts of what in shorthand may be called money laundering.  There were three statutory offences charged.  Counts 1, 2 and 11 charged offences of entering into an agreement to acquire, retain, use, or control criminal property contrary to s.328 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 ("POCA").  Counts 3, 5, 7, 9, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30 and 32 alleged 15 offences of transferring criminal property contrary to s.327 of  POCA.  Counts 4, 6, 8, 10, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, 31 and 33 alleged 15 offences of removing criminal property from England and Wales to Jamaica also contrary to s.327.  Ss.327 and 328 appear in Part 7 of the Act (cross-headed "Money Laundering").

 
The overall period covered by the indictment was 1 July 2003 - 3 July 2005, though individual offences were said to have been committed over shorter periods within the overall span.

 
As we have indicated there were four defendants.  The Crown's case was that the prime mover was the defendant NW.  Something over £105,000 was transferred out of the UK to Jamaica.  The Crown alleged that all of it represented the proceeds of criminal conduct in which NW was involved.  The other three defendants were related to or associated with NW.  Each of counts 1, 2 and 11 alleged an agreement contrary to s.328 between NW and one of the other defendants, in effect to carry out the transactions charged in the two groups of offences contrary to s.327:  first, the transfer of money from NW to the three others, and secondly the removal of the money by those three from the UK to Jamaica.  

 
The total sum said to have been the subject of the arrangements charged at counts 1, 2 and 11 was £105,198.  The sum involved in the first set of s.327 charges  transfer by NW to the other 3  was £32,999:  and the sum involved in the second set  removal from the UK to Jamaica  was also £32,999.  It was of course the same money.  This figure differs from that involved in counts 1, 2 and 11 because the s.327 counts were specimen charges.

 
In order to bring home any or all of these offences the Crown had to prove that the funds involved constituted "criminal property" within the meaning of POCA s.340, which also defines "criminal conduct" for the purpose of these statutory offences.  S.340 provides in part as follows:

 
"(2)	Criminal conduct is conduct which 
(a) constitutes an offence in any part of the United Kingdom, or 
(b) would constitute an offence in any part of the United Kingdom if it occurred there.
(3)	       Property is criminal property if 
(a) it constitutes a person's benefit from criminal conduct or it represents such a benefit (in whole or in part and whether directly or indirectly), and	  
(b) the alleged offender knows or suspects that it constitutes such a benefit.
(4)	It is immaterial  
	                    (a)  who carried out the conduct;
				(b)  who benefited from it.
(5)		A person benefits from conduct if he obtains property as a result of or in connection with the conduct."
It will be necessary to consider certain other provisions, contained in Part 5 of POCA, when we come to review the relevant authorities, but it will be convenient to set those out at that stage.
The essence of the issue in this appeal may be put shortly.  To establish  guilt under s.327 or s.328, must the Crown prove what particular criminal conduct, or at least what type of criminal conduct, has generated the benefit which the alleged criminal property represents?  Or is it enough if they can show, no doubt by reference to the large sums involved and the defendants' want of any apparent means of substance (as well as any other relevant evidence), that the money in question can have had no lawful origin  even if they have no evidence of  the crime or class of crime involved?  The Crown say the latter suffices.  In his terminating ruling the learned trial judge held that it did not.  He granted leave to appeal on these grounds:

 
"1	 [T]he learned judge erred in ruling at the close of the Crown's case that the defendants had no case to answer because the monies they allegedly transferred to Jamaica could not be criminal property as the prosecution had no evidence of specific criminal conduct, or even a particular type of conduct, on the part of any defendant, so that all the prosecution could say is that those monies had no lawful origin.
2	[T]he learned judge erred in ruling that the circumstances surrounding the origin of the monies transferred created a reverse burden of proof for the defendants to overcome.

LORD JUSTICE HOOPER:  I will ask Mr Justice Silber to give the judgment of the court.

MR JUSTICE SILBER:
 Liam Paul O'Reilly appeals with the leave of the single judge against a sentence of nine years' detention in a young offender institution which was imposed on him in the Crown Court at Liverpool on 13 July 2007.  He had previously pleaded guilty on re-arraignment to a count of manslaughter.  

 
 
 The background is that the victim of the offence, Phillip Campbell, was the partner of the appellant's elder sister.  The appellant's co-accused was his uncle.  The relationship between Phillip Campbell and the appellant's sister had been both violent and tempestuous.  There had been complaints that he had been violent towards her on a number of occasions in the past and that he had attacked her with knives as well as assaulting her and her 3 year old son.  There was, for example, an allegation that on 1 January 2007 Phillip Campbell had put his arms around the throat of the appellant's sister.  

 
 
 The events which gave rise to this charge occurred on 10 January 2007 when the appellant's sister, her son and Phillip Campbell were visiting a friend, Andrew Abley.  Phillip Campbell refused to give the appellant's sister the key to their.  He slapped her hard on the face, punched her and kicked her.  At some stage he used a kitchen knife to stab the appellant's sister in the thigh.  At this point Andrew Abley ran to the home of the appellant's uncle and he told the appellant that "Francine's getting battered, you had better get round there".  Both the appellant and the co-accused went to Andrew Abley's house.  The appellant shouted at Phillip Campbell, "Get outside, Phil".  The appellant's sister told the police that Phillip Campbell was known to have used knives in the past.  The judge assumed (and we will do likewise) that the appellant had not taken a knife to the house of Andrew Abley, but that he had picked one up there.  

 
 
 A time came when Phillip Campbell ran out of the back door.  He was pursued by the appellant and his uncle through the back gardens of neighbouring houses.  They eventually caught up with him.  Neighbours heard a man shouting "And don't you come near my fucking sister again".  The appellant at that point must have stabbed Campbell because when the police arrived they found that Campbell was already dead in the garden.  The cause of his death was multiple stab wounds.  He had received eight wounds, of which six were to the abdomen, and two to the face.  One had entered the chest and penetrated his heart.  There was also a stab wound to the left, the right, the front and the back of his body.  His internal organs had been penetrated.  Two of the wounds had fractured his ribs.  The opinion of the pathologist was that the wounds would require considerable force.  There were also bruising and abrasions which were consistent with the application of force by way of impact with a heavy staircase post.  

 
 
 Searches were made by the police.  They found a knife with Campbell.  In a nearby grid they found the weapon that had been used to inflict the fatal wound.

 
 
 Two days later the appellant and his uncle surrendered to the police.  

 
 
 The appellant was born on 16 August 1988.  He was therefore 18 years of age at the time of the offence.  He had a number of minor convictions, but he had never previously served a custodial sentence.  On 31 May 2001 he was convicted of common assault.  On 11 October 2005 he was convicted of battery, for which he received a supervision order.  

 
 
 The pre-sentence report noted that the appellant had expressed remorse.  

 
 
 In sentencing the appellant the judge took account of the age of the appellant, his record and the fact that in this case the provocation was, on any view, substantial.  The ground of appeal is that the sentence was manifestly excessive.

 
 
 In our view the judge must have adopted too high a starting point.  As the judge pointed out, this was a case of substantial provocation.  This is not a case where the appellant had deliberately gone out with a weapon and used it to cause the death of the victim.  There is no reference in the transcript of the prosecution opening or the judge's sentencing remarks to the guidelines issued by the Sentencing Guidelines Council for manslaughter by reason of provocation.  These guidelines apply to anybody who was convicted after 28 November 2005.  They are therefore applicable to this case.  

 
 
 The guidelines refer to three classes of provocation: a low degree, a substantial degree and a high degree.  The judge took the view that this a substantial degree of provocation.  We agree with that.  This was not a case of a high degree of provocation, bearing in mind that the appellant and his co-accused were chasing the victim rather than being chased by him.  The starting point for those cases is eight years' custody.  The aggravating feature in this case was the substantial number of stab wounds that were inflicted and which we have described.  On the other hand there are mitigating factors: the appellant's age, the fact that he had shown remorse, and there was an anticipated fear of violence from the victim.  In our view on the particular facts of this case the aggravating and mitigating factors balance themselves out.  

 
 
 We have concluded that in the circumstances of this case we can agree with the submissions of Mr Marks QC for the appellant that there should be a 25 per cent reduction on account of the guilty plea.  Therefore that reduces the sentence to six years' detention in a young offender institution.  To that extent the appeal is allowed.

LORD JUSTICE HOOPER:  I will ask Mr Justice Silber to give the judgment of the court.

MR JUSTICE SILBER:
 Liam Paul O'Reilly appeals with the leave of the single judge against a sentence of nine years' detention in a young offender institution which was imposed on him in the Crown Court at Liverpool on 13 July 2007.  He had previously pleaded guilty on re-arraignment to a count of manslaughter.  

 
 
 The background is that the victim of the offence, Phillip Campbell, was the partner of the appellant's elder sister.  The appellant's co-accused was his uncle.  The relationship between Phillip Campbell and the appellant's sister had been both violent and tempestuous.  There had been complaints that he had been violent towards her on a number of occasions in the past and that he had attacked her with knives as well as assaulting her and her 3 year old son.  There was, for example, an allegation that on 1 January 2007 Phillip Campbell had put his arms around the throat of the appellant's sister.  

 
 
 The events which gave rise to this charge occurred on 10 January 2007 when the appellant's sister, her son and Phillip Campbell were visiting a friend, Andrew Abley.  Phillip Campbell refused to give the appellant's sister the key to their.  He slapped her hard on the face, punched her and kicked her.  At some stage he used a kitchen knife to stab the appellant's sister in the thigh.  At this point Andrew Abley ran to the home of the appellant's uncle and he told the appellant that "Francine's getting battered, you had better get round there".  Both the appellant and the co-accused went to Andrew Abley's house.  The appellant shouted at Phillip Campbell, "Get outside, Phil".  The appellant's sister told the police that Phillip Campbell was known to have used knives in the past.  The judge assumed (and we will do likewise) that the appellant had not taken a knife to the house of Andrew Abley, but that he had picked one up there.  

 
 
 A time came when Phillip Campbell ran out of the back door.  He was pursued by the appellant and his uncle through the back gardens of neighbouring houses.  They eventually caught up with him.  Neighbours heard a man shouting "And don't you come near my fucking sister again".  The appellant at that point must have stabbed Campbell because when the police arrived they found that Campbell was already dead in the garden.  The cause of his death was multiple stab wounds.  He had received eight wounds, of which six were to the abdomen, and two to the face.  One had entered the chest and penetrated his heart.  There was also a stab wound to the left, the right, the front and the back of his body.  His internal organs had been penetrated.  Two of the wounds had fractured his ribs.  The opinion of the pathologist was that the wounds would require considerable force.  There were also bruising and abrasions which were consistent with the application of force by way of impact with a heavy staircase post.  

 
 
 Searches were made by the police.  They found a knife with Campbell.  In a nearby grid they found the weapon that had been used to inflict the fatal wound.

 
 
 Two days later the appellant and his uncle surrendered to the police.  

 
 
 The appellant was born on 16 August 1988.  He was therefore 18 years of age at the time of the offence.  He had a number of minor convictions, but he had never previously served a custodial sentence.  On 31 May 2001 he was convicted of common assault.  On 11 October 2005 he was convicted of battery, for which he received a supervision order.  

 
 
 The pre-sentence report noted that the appellant had expressed remorse.  

 
 
 In sentencing the appellant the judge took account of the age of the appellant, his record and the fact that in this case the provocation was, on any view, substantial.  The ground of appeal is that the sentence was manifestly excessive.

 
 
 In our view the judge must have adopted too high a starting point.  As the judge pointed out, this was a case of substantial provocation.  This is not a case where the appellant had deliberately gone out with a weapon and used it to cause the death of the victim.  There is no reference in the transcript of the prosecution opening or the judge's sentencing remarks to the guidelines issued by the Sentencing Guidelines Council for manslaughter by reason of provocation.  These guidelines apply to anybody who was convicted after 28 November 2005.  They are therefore applicable to this case.  

 
 
 The guidelines refer to three classes of provocation: a low degree, a substantial degree and a high degree.  The judge took the view that this a substantial degree of provocation.  We agree with that.  This was not a case of a high degree of provocation, bearing in mind that the appellant and his co-accused were chasing the victim rather than being chased by him.  The starting point for those cases is eight years' custody.  The aggravating feature in this case was the substantial number of stab wounds that were inflicted and which we have described.  On the other hand there are mitigating factors: the appellant's age, the fact that he had shown remorse, and there was an anticipated fear of violence from the victim.  In our view on the particular facts of this case the aggravating and mitigating factors balance themselves out.  

 
 
 We have concluded that in the circumstances of this case we can agree with the submissions of Mr Marks QC for the appellant that there should be a 25 per cent reduction on account of the guilty plea.  Therefore that reduces the sentence to six years' detention in a young offender institution.  To that extent the appeal is allowed.

MR JUSTICE WYN WILLIAMS:  On 4th September 2007 at the Crown Court at Harrow, the appellant was sentenced by His Honour Judge Moss to a total term of imprisonment of three years in respect of a number of different offences of dishonesty.  With the leave of the single judge he appeals to this court against that sentence.  The only ground of appeal is that the total term of three years is manifestly excessive.

 
The first offences in time occurred on 4th December 2005 in the town of Slough.  During the evening of that day, the police received a report that a number of motor vehicles which had been parked in a public car park were the subject of attack by a number of men.  On investigation the police discovered that four vehicles had been broken into and that a number of items had been taken from three of them.  The same day a car in which the appellant was a passenger was stopped by police officers and the men inside were arrested.  When he was interviewed about the offences, the appellant claimed that he had been asleep in the car and had simply been woken up by police sirens.  

 
In due course the appellant was charged with three offences of theft and one offence of attempted theft arising out of this incident.  He was then released on bail and he was due to appear at the Slough Magistrates Court on 5th May 2006.  However, on that day the appellant failed to surrender to his bail.  Accordingly a bench warrant was issued which was in due course executed.  

 
Although the appellant remained in custody for some time, he was released on bail again in early August 2006.  The appellant committed his next offence on 16th September 2006.  This was in Luton.  On that day a lady who was in the process of going to work decided first to buy herself a television set worth about £1,500.  Because she was due to start work shortly after the purchase, she left the television set in her locked car at or near her place of work and then began her shift which was at 4.30 in the afternoon.  At about 6.30 she was informed that her car had been broken into and when she went to investigate she discovered that the television set had been stolen.  The appellant was soon implicated in this offence because he had cut himself when breaking into the car and he had left traces of his blood within the car which allowed a DNA match to be made.  He was arrested on 30th October 2006 for this offence and made no comment when he was interviewed.  

 
On 8th November 2006 he was again released on bail.  The terms of his bail demanded that he surrender to the magistrates on 15th November, but again the appellant failed to appear.  The day before, however, the appellant committed his next offence.  Again it was the theft of an item from a motor vehicle.  At about 6.30 pm on this day the owner of the vehicle in question parked it at a Travelodge in Burnt Oak - obviously because he intended to stay the night at the Travelodge.  By 9.00 pm the car had been broken into and an item taken from it, that item being a charge unit for a satellite navigation system.  On this occasion the appellant left a glove behind and again through a DNA match his involvement was ascertained in the offence.  He was not arrested for it, however, until 25th May 2007.  

 
Some days before that arrest the appellant committed a domestic burglary in North London.  This offence occurred on 10th May 2007 and it was at the home of a retired couple.  They left their home empty and secure at about 11.00 am on the morning of the offence and when they returned home in the afternoon they discovered that there had been a burglary.  A satellite navigation system and a mobile telephone had been taken.  The conservatory door had been jemmied open and that is how entry had been gained.  Again forensic evidence was found which led to the appellant being interviewed.

 
For this catalogue of offences the individual sentences imposed were as follows.  The three offences of theft and one offence of attempted theft in Slough attracted sentences of eight months concurrent.  For failing to surrender to his bail following those offences the judge imposed a term of one month.  In relation to the theft of the television from the car in Luton, the judge imposed a sentence of eight months and for failing to surrender to bail following that offence a term of one month.  For the theft from a car in Burnt Oak the judge imposed a sentence of three months and for the burglary of the dwelling-house the judge imposed a sentence of 15 months.  All the sentences, save for those in respect of the offences in Slough, were ordered to run consecutively, hence the total of three years.

 
At the time the appellant committed the offences in Luton, Burnt Oak and in North London he was on bail and subject to a community order.  When he committed all his offences he was subject to a community punishment order which he had not completed.

 
The appellant came before the Crown Court because he had been committed for sentence.  At the time of his sentence before the Crown Court he asked for 17 further offences of theft and three offences of causing damage to be taken into consideration.  

 
On the basis of the pre-sentence report available, the principal mitigation advanced was that the appellant had pleaded guilty.  It could not be said that he had done so at the first opportunity in relation to some at least of the offences, not least because he had failed to surrender to his bail, but of course he was entitled to some reduction in the sentence on account of his guilty pleas.  

 
The appellant was aged 29 at the time of sentencing.  He had been convicted by courts on six occasions before his appearance at the Crown Court but he had never before been sentenced to imprisonment.  The likelihood is that his offending was motivated by the need to obtain money or goods with a view to buying drugs.  

 
As we have said, the only ground which is pressed before us is that a total term of three years was manifestly excessive.  No complaint has been made or could be made about the principle of consecutive sentencing in this case.  To repeat, the attack is made simply upon the total sentence.  

 
Some assistance is derived by the appellant from prison reports which have been provided to this court which show that he is making good progress in prison and which therefore demonstrates that some of the negative things said about him in the pre-sentence report may not have been wholly accurate.  Nonetheless, in our judgment the issue we have to address is whether or not the totality of this sentence was in truth manifestly excessive.  We recognise that it was a first sentence of imprisonment, but given this escalating series of offences, coupled with a failure to surrender to bail on two occasions, we are not persuaded that the total is manifestly excessive.  We accept that the sentence is at the upper end of the appropriate range, but in our judgment it is no more than that.  In all the circumstances this appeal must be dismissed.

MR JUSTICE WILKIE:  This is the appeal of Perry Pratchet, now aged 19, against a sentence of three years' detention in a young offender institution imposed at Snaresbrook Crown Court by the learned Recorder on 20th September 2006, he having pleaded guilty on 16th July at a plea and case management hearing to a single offence of attempted robbery.  The appeal is with leave of the single judge.

 
The victim was an art dealer and at about 1.00 am on 11th March 2007 he was making his way home.  He was approached by two men, one of whom (the appellant) asked him for money.  He said: "No, I'm sorry".  The victim had been the subject of robberies on two previous occasions and was concerned about these two men and so crossed the road, but they followed him.  The appellant said: "Are you starting?"  When the victim did not reply, he punched him on the left side of his face, cutting his lip, bruising his cheek and aggravating a jaw fracture sustained in one of the previous robberies.  The victim fell to the ground and was not sure whether he lost consciousness.  

 
A more graphic description of the attack was provided by two passers-by in a car who saw the assault.  They described it as a ferocious, sustained attack followed by an attempt to steal from the victim - something the victim himself was not able to recall.  One of those witnesses saw the appellant strike the victim in the face very hard, strike him to the chest and face, then saw the victim cross the road, the appellant punched him again to the chest and headbutted him to the face causing him to drop to the floor in the middle of the road.  The appellant then repeatedly continued to hit the victim whilst he lay prone on the floor, putting his hands into the victim's jacket pockets as he lay on the floor, the victim not moving at all.  That witness went to assist the victim.  He flagged down a passing police car and the appellant was found hiding in a nearby graveyard.  The victim was able to identify his attacker in an identification parade.  The other occupant of the car saw that the victim was crying, clearly upset and shaken by the incident.

 
The appellant, as we have indicated, was aged 18 at the time of the robbery, 19 at the date of sentence.  He had no relevant previous convictions.  He had written to the court a letter expressing his shame and remorse for what he had done.  It said that he had not planned it and he was very drunk at the time.  

 
The learned Recorder said that he took into account the guilty plea and also the support of his family.  His mother was in court at sentence and is indeed in court today.  She had written to the judge indicating a wish to move from the area where it would appear she blamed others for getting the appellant into bad company.  The judge, however, went on to say that this was a vicious and extremely horrific piece of violence committed in the streets on this unfortunate gentleman, but for the intervention of the witnesses it could have been much worse.

 
The judge did not have before him any particular detail of the injuries suffered by the victim and so he did not sentence on the basis of any further aggravation by reason of those possible serious injuries.  He sentenced on the basis of the description given by the witnesses.  He therefore imposed a sentence of three years' detention in a young offender institution.  Mr Cohen has argued before us, as he did in the grounds of appeal, that this sentence of three years was manifestly excessive.  It seems to us that we must assume that the judge gave full credit for the plea of guilty which had been a timely one and that therefore the sentence after trial which the judge used to base the three year sentence would have been one of four-and-a-half years.  

 
Our attention has been drawn to the Sentencing Guidelines Council definitive guidance on robbery issued in July 2006.  This is a scale two robbery where force was used resulting in injury to the victim of the street robbery or mugging variety.  The starting point for a person of 17 is said to be three years' detention, whereas for an adult the starting point is four years.  There are a number of aggravating and mitigating factors which are listed.  Mr Cohen says that in this particular case there are mitigating factors in that it was an unplanned street robbery and there was clear evidence of remorse.  On the other hand, there are, it seems to us, certain aggravating features.  Certainly the fact is that although two persons were not actually involved in the attack to the point that the other man was either apprehended or charged, the victim was certainly confronted by two people initially and saw fit to move away from them.  Furthermore, this offence was committed at night.  It cannot be said that this victim was obviously a vulnerable victim, though in fact it turned out that he was particularly vulnerable to injury sustained by the beating because of the previous robberies of which he had been subject.  

 
It seems to us that there is some merit in the argument of Mr Cohen that having regard to the guidelines a starting point after a trial of four-and-a-half years was manifestly excessive.  Whilst this appellant was older than 17, he certainly was not an adult and therefore the starting point must have been somewhere between three and four years.  Although there are aggravating features, not least the serious nature of the beating which he administered to the victim, there are also mitigating features.  It seems to us that the appropriate starting point for sentence after a trial for this appellant would have been one of three-and-a-half years.  Giving him full credit for his timely plea of guilty, it would have resulted in a sentence of 28 months -- ie two years and four months.  It seems to us that to that extent the sentence of three years was manifestly excessive and therefore we allow this appeal to the extent of substituting for the sentence of three years, which we quash, one of two years and four months' detention.

	LORD JUSTICE PILL:  On 6th July 2007 in the Crown Court at Swansea, before His Honour Judge Diehl QC and a jury, Ian Jon Pulley was convicted of inflicting grievous bodily harm, contrary to section 20 of the Offences Against the Person Act 1861.  On 15th August 2007 he was sentenced to an extended sentence of 5 years, pursuant to section 227 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, made up of a custodial term of 3 years' imprisonment and an extension period of 2 years.

 
	Pulley appeals against conviction by leave of the single judge.

 
	The point at issue is the admission into evidence of statements made by the victim of the alleged assault.  The alleged victim was the wife of the appellant, Kimberley Pulley.  On 1st March 2006 she received a substantial injury to her left hand.  The tip of her ring finger was severed and the tip of her little finger partially severed.  The prosecution case was that the appellant had caused the injuries by assaulting the complainant, first by stabbing her with a fork in the thigh, where there were signs of injury, and then by attacking her with a machete.  The appellant, her husband, denied the offence.  His case was that the injury to the hand had been caused when the complainant accidentally trapped her fingers in the door at the matrimonial home.  He denied stabbing the complainant in the thigh with a fork.  He denied using a machete to injure her hand.

 
	Sadly, the complainant died, for reasons unconnected with the events of 1st March, later in 2007 and before the trial.  A successful application was made to put in evidence three statements which she made about the events of that day, the first of them being given on 2nd March, the day immediately following the date of the alleged offence.

 
	Counsel have agreed what needs to be mentioned as indicating the substance of her evidence, or "the high point", as counsel put it.  There was an argument about what they were going to have for dinner.  She had prepared salad; he wanted chips.  He stabbed her twice with a fork to her thighs.  It was, however, the injury to the hand which formed the substance of the charge, and the issues argued before the jury.

 
	The appellant went to the utility room and took possession of a machete, which they owned and used on occasions in the preparation of meat for eating.  He joined her in the kitchen.  Her account, as recorded in her statement, was:

 
"He was shouting and bawling, 'I am going to have you'.  At that stage I really did think that he would hurt me, but did not believe that he would use the machete.  For some reason I raised my left hand to protect my head, and I then felt extreme pain in my left hand and saw that the top of my little and ring finger of my left hand had been chopped off.  At home and in the ambulance and at the hospital he kept telling me to say I had hurt my fingers in the door.  But after I had told an ambulance man that it was an accident, I decided that I was going to tell the truth about what he had done.  While I cannot be sure that he used the machete, as I was and still am in such shock."
In the statement she maintained that she had not been drinking that evening, and said that she was willing to have a blood test to demonstrate that she had not been drinking.
	In a subsequent statement the complainant purported to identify the machete, and she said that it had been used in order to bone a breast of lamb about a month before 1st March.  In a later statement the complainant also said:

 
"I know he will say it was an accident, that I jammed my hand in the door.  This was no accident.  He hurt me with the machete.  He also stabbed both my legs with the fork, causing injuries.  I did not do these myself."
	The appellant summoned an ambulance to the house.  The paramedic who attended, Mr Harris, gave evidence that the appellant had told him that he had had an argument with his wife and she had caught her fingers in the door when he was shutting it.  When Mr Harris saw the complainant she did not tell him how the injury had been caused.  In the ambulance and in the absence of the appellant, she said "He did it", but Mr Harris thought that the comment related to the door-shutting account given to him by the appellant.  However, an argument persisted in the ambulance, the complainant saying, "You did it, you did it" to her husband.  He did not hear the appellant telling the complainant to say that she had trapped her fingers in the door.

 
	Mr Fair, another paramedic who attended in the ambulance, said that the complainant also told him that her hand had become stuck in the door.  He had suspicions about that, having observed the nature of the injury to the hand.  He confirmed that the complainant was saying, "He did it".  He notified his suspicions to Senior Nurse Sharp after they had reached the hospital.

 
	A nurse at the hospital, Mr Powell, said that the complainant had told him in the presence of the appellant that the appellant had purposely trapped her fingers in the door, and he also made a report to Nurse Sharp, his supervisor.  The complainant asked for Mr Powell's help in calling the police.

 
	Miss Sharp gave evidence of the reports of concern to her, and that the complainant had told at a later stage that the appellant had deliberately caused her injuries with a machete.  The complainant made that complaint to her.  Nurse Sharp had known the complainant for many years. 

 
	Two police officers also gave evidence by way of statements that the complainant had told them that the appellant had assaulted her with a machete.  Medical evidence was given by Dr Yaqoob, consultant orthopaedic surgeon.  He had not examined the complainant, but had seen medical notes which included a photograph of the injury.  His evidence, as summarised by the judge, accurately as counsel agree, was that the injury to the hand was on a balance of probability more likely to have been caused by a sharp instrument than it was by a closing door, though the other possibility could not be excluded.

 
	Dr Yaqoob referred to notes prepared by his junior, Dr Danana, who had seen the complainant on admission, and Dr Danana had noted that the appellant had trapped her fingers in the door.  He also noted that the complainant was at that time under the influence of drink.

 
	A scenes of crime officer, Detective Constable Morris, found bloodstains on the carpet in the lounge of the home and some on the front settee.  There was a blood-stained towel in the kitchen, but no blood or blood trail was found on the kitchen floor.  The door frame, where the appellant alleged the injury had occurred, found a "weak positive" for blood, and that was at hand level on the door.

 
	The machete identified, and not disputed to be the family machete, was examined by Mr Little, a scientific witness.  He found no trace of the complainant's DNA on it or on its sheath.  However, some non-human material was found on one side of the handle towards the blade.  He accepted that a bladed weapon may not become blood-stained as a result of a single strike, but he would have expected the transfer to the blade of some cellular material from the victim, and no such material was found.  As to the suggestion that the knife had been cleaned, it was accepted that one would then have expected the non-human material found on it also to have been removed.

 
	The complainant provided a sample of blood for analysis.  It was found to contain a substantial percentage of alcohol.  A back calculation was done which showed the likely reading at the time of the relevant events in the house to have been several times above the legal limit for driving.

 
	The appellant gave evidence.  He described the events of the evening.  He had been drinking cider.  He had not seen his wife drinking, though she had had a serious drinking problem.  He went into the kitchen to wash up after dinner.  He closed the door to the living room by leaning against it with his bottom, using enough force to shut it.  He was not aware that his wife was near the door.  As he shut it, he heard a scream and saw something fall to the ground, which was the end of her finger.  It was bloody.  He took a flannel from the bathroom and wrapped it round her fingers.  He took her to the settee and sat her down, putting a bag of frozen food on the finger.  He called the emergency services.

 
	The appellant denied that he told his wife what to say to the paramedics or to the hospital staff.  He recalled her telling a doctor that she had shut her fingers in a window.  There was evidence that a number of affectionate letters had been sent by the complainant to him following the events and his remand into custody.

 
	In terms of weight on the door, the appellant said in cross-examination that he put his full weight of 19½ stone in his attempt to shut the door.  He denied cleaning the blade of the machete on his return.

 
	The judge summed up the case in great detail, and no criticism is made of his summing-up.  He did consider in detail the inconsistencies which were present in the prosecution case and the submissions which had properly been made on the appellant's behalf by Mr Walters of counsel, who appears before this court.

 
	Mr Walters submits that the written statements should not in these circumstances have been admitted.  His submission is that there was no sufficient assessment of the reliability of the maker of the statement, and a decision that the statements qualified for admission was inappropriate.  He submits that the decision was outside the discretion of the judge if properly exercised.

 
	Mr Spackman, for the prosecution, of course relies on the breadth of the judge's discretion when deciding on the admission of evidence.  The court should not interfere with that.  The judge conducted a proper exercise in relation to reliability and was entitled to admit the evidence.  Unfortunately, the judge was not referred to the statutory requirements in section 114(2) of the Act.

 
	The submission is that the trial was rendered unfair by the admission of the complainant's statements.  The starting point is, of course, Article 6(3)(d) of the European Convention on Human Rights, which provides that everyone charged with a criminal offence has certain minimum rights, one of which is:

 
"to examine or have examined witnesses against him ..."
	Reference was made to Luca v Italy (2003) 36 EHRR 46.  That ruling and more general considerations have been the subject of consideration in the courts of England and Wales.  It is accepted, by virtue of section 114 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 ("the 2003 Act"), that statements may be admitted.  The test as to admissibility is set out in section 114(2):

 
"In deciding whether a statement not made in oral evidence should be admitted under subsection (1)(d), the court must have regard to the following factors (and to any others it considers relevant)   
 (a) how much probative value the statement has (assuming it to be true) in relation to a matter in issue in the proceedings, or how valuable it is for the understanding of other evidence in the case; 
 (b) what other evidence has been, or can be, given on the matter or evidence mentioned in paragraph (a); 
 (c) how important the matter or evidence mentioned in paragraph (a) is in the context of the case as a whole; 
 (d) the circumstances in which the statement was made; 
 (e) how reliable the maker of the statement appears to be; 
 (f) how reliable the evidence of the making of the statement appears to be; 
 (g) whether oral evidence of the matter stated can be given and, if not, why it cannot; 
 (h) the amount of difficulty involved in challenging the statement; 
 (i) the extent to which that difficulty would be likely to prejudice the party facing it."
	Section 116 specifies the situations in which a witness is "unavailable" for the purpose of that consideration, and the death of the proposed witness is, of course, one such situation (section 116(2)(a)).

 
	Attention is also drawn to the general discretion to exclude evidence under section 78 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 ("the 1984 Act"), preserved by section 126(2) of the 2003 Act, where:

 
"... having regard to all the circumstances, including the circumstances in which the evidence was obtained, the admission of the evidence would have such an adverse effect on the fairness of the proceedings that the court ought not to admit it."
	In his ruling, which was also in some detail and gave careful consideration to the points raised, save that unfortunately section 114(2) was not referred to, the judge concluded, by way of explanation of a ruling given the previous afternoon:

 
"... I ruled shortly yesterday that the statements should be admitted and that their admission in evidence would not have such an adverse [effect] upon the fairness of these proceedings that I should decide otherwise or indeed such as to render the proceedings as a whole unfair to the defendant."
	In the course of the ruling, the judge had said, having referred to the contradictions in the complainant's statement and other matters raised:

 
"That again, in my judgment, I interpose, is an asset which aids the defence not the prosecution and does not need or require [in justice] to the defendant any further exploration."
	Again, at page 11D:

 
"As to the lie about drink and intoxication itself, those matters in my view clearly serve to assist the defence."
	The circumstances in which statements should be admitted were considered in this court in R v Imad Al-Khawaja [2005] EWCA Crim 2697, the judgment of the court being given by Jack J.  That was a case where the defendant was convicted of two counts of indecent assault on a female.  The prosecution case was that the allegations of the two complainants were mutually supportive.  The prosecution also relied on the strikingly similar evidence from two other women.  One of the complainants had died and the judge admitted her statement.

 
	It was held in this court that the judge had been entitled to do so.  The defendant was able to attack the accuracy of the relevant complainant by exploring the inconsistencies between her statement and the other witnesses.  The court referred to the strong public interest in the admission of a statement in circumstances such as those, though it must not override (the court stated at paragraph 26) the requirement that the defendant have a fair trial.

 
	The judge noted that it was not a case where collusion between the complainants was suggested.  There was nothing to suggest that the women knew the details of each other's allegations, and evidence of improper suggestions made to the other two witnesses who gave evidence.  The court concluded: 

 
"28.  We have concluded that the rights of the appellant under Article 6 were not infringed by the admission of the statement.  We consider that his rights were sufficiently protected in the circumstances of his case.  His trial was not unfair."
	The court went on to say that appropriate directions to the jury were required and were given.  The court concluded:

 
"We should also say that overall the evidence against the appellant was very strong.  We were wholly unpersuaded that the verdicts were unsafe."
	Two separate cases were considered by this court in R v Cole and Keet [2007] EWCA Crim 1924, Lord Phillips CJ presiding.  The Lord Chief Justice referred to Article 6 and to the statutory requirement, which we have already cited.  At paragraph 10, the court cited the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights in Luca:

 
"The evidence must normally be produced at a public hearing, in the presence of the accused, with a view to adversarial argument.  There are exceptions to this principle, but they must not infringe the rights of the defence.  As a general rule, Art. 6(1) and (3)(d) require that the defendant be given an adequate and proper opportunity to challenge and question a witness against him, either when he makes his statement or at a later stage."
	Having considered Luca, the court stated at paragraph 13:

 
"Furthermore, Luca was a case where the evidence in question was the main evidence against the accused.  It cannot be treated as authority for the proposition that in all circumstances hearsay evidence cannot be adduced unless the defendant is able, or has had the opportunity, to examine the maker."
	At paragraph 21:

 
"21.	  There are many reasons why it may be impossible to call a witness.  Where the defendant is himself responsible for that fact, he is in no position to complain that he has been denied a fair trial if a statement from that witness is admitted.  Where the witness is dead, or cannot be called for some other reason, the question of whether the admission of a statement from that witness will impair the fairness of the trial will be depend on the facts of the particular case.  Factors that will be likely to be of concern to the court are identified in section 114(2) of the Act.
22.  	In accordance with these conclusions, we shall proceed to consider the individual appeals on the basis that Article 6 imposes no absolute embargo on the admission of the hearsay evidence adduced by the prosecution in either case."
The court went on to consider the facts of the two cases and held that statements had in each case properly been admitted.
	Keet was convicted of attempting to obtain property by deception (count 3) and damaging property (count 4).  The prosecution case was in part based on the evidence of Mrs Soper, a lady who was 82 years old.  She was approached by the defendant with a view to doing roofing work on her house.  She was told that further work would be required and would cost £6,000.  Mrs Soper said that she would have to get this from the bank.  She told her daughter what had happened and her daughter was angry, whereupon the matter was reported to the police.

 
	Inspection of the roof revealed that a tile had been lifted and a piece of roofing felt cut out.  This formed the subject matter of count 4.  The prosecution case was that the damage was caused deliberately so as to justify the further work for which £6,000 was claimed.  Evidence was called that the original work done should have cost about £100, and evidence critical of the work in fact done was produced.

 
	In that context the court considered, at paragraph 38, the provisions of section 114.  Amongst their comments were these:

 
"d) The circumstances in which the statement was made suggested that the maker believed in the truth of the statement.  It was not suggested by the appellant that the evidence in question was untruthful; indeed he accepted that part of it was accurate.  He merely contended that Mrs Soper must have been mistaken as to certain other parts.
e)  There is ... a degree of confusion in the statement about particular dates.  Overall, however, the statement paints a coherent picture and it has been accepted that Mrs Soper, although elderly and subsequently affected by dementia, was rational when she made it."
In those circumstances the court held that the judge had been right to admit the statement.
	Cole was convicted of assault occasioning actual bodily harm to his girlfriend, now deceased.  The witness not able to give evidence was Sharon Tracey, her room-mate, and count 1 was based on Sharon Tracey's evidence of witnessing the appellant assault her on three separate occasions.  The background was of course the inability of the deceased victim, Katy Smith, to give evidence.  It was accepted that on count 2 the case depended largely on statements alleged to have been made by the deceased to her brother, also not available to give evidence.  Other witnesses gave evidence of upset and injury of the deceased, including evidence that she had had a black eye.  Count 3 was based on inferences to be drawn from the injuries found on the body of the deceased.

 
	In this case, too, the court considered the overall impact of the evidence in relation to the non-availability of an important witness.  The court concluded:

 
"73.  	The facts of this case are very different from those of Keet.  If each statement is considered in isolation it is both less cogent and less significant than the evidence of Mrs Soper.  The statements are lacking in detail and in precision as to date.  When the factors in section 114 are considered in respect of an individual statement, the case for admission is weaker than it is in Keet.  But the correct approach is not to consider each statement on its own, but to consider it in its context.  Each statement is part of a wider picture.  That picture is coherent and compelling.  It is of a relationship between the deceased and the appellant that was punctuated by physical violence on his part."
	The court set out the detail, including the closeness of the relationship and the presence of the injuries.  The court concluded that:

 
"78.  ... the admission of the hearsay evidence was in the interests of justice and consistent with a fair trial."
	Mr Walters submits that both those cases are distinguishable, on the general principles to be applied, because the evidence in the present case emerging from the statements of the deceased does not fit into the coherent picture present in the other cases and is not accepted by the defendant.

 
	Reliance is placed on the case of R v Sellick [2005] EWCA Crim 651 (to which reference was made in paragraph 16 of Keet and Cole).  Waller LJ, giving the judgment of the court, stated propositions resulting from the Strasbourg decisions, one of which, (iv), cited at paragraph 16: 

 
"iv)	  The quality of the evidence and its inherent reliability, plus the degree of caution exercised in relation to reliance on it, will also be relevant to the question whether the trial was fair."
	Mr Walters submits that the evidence is not inherently reliable.  He relies on a number of factors emerging from other evidence before the court.  First, there was no blood apparent in the kitchen where the violence was alleged to have taken place.  Second, the blood spattering was throughout the lounge, which is where the complainant was led so that she could sit and wait for the ambulance.  Third, there was blood on the door frame at about handle level, and that was consistent with the appellant's account of where the injury had been sustained.  Fourth, a spot of blood was found on the carpet below the point where the appellant said the injury had taken place.  Fifth, the scientific examination of the machete did not show blood.  As to the suggestion that it had been cleaned, and the appellant had the opportunity to clean, the presence of non-human tissue, that would have resulted from the lamb boning, was still there.

 
	In relation to the reliability of the complainant's evidence, Mr Walters relies upon the contents of the report of the request for emergency assistance, which was consistent with the appellant's account.  A paramedic gave evidence that the complainant had given an account that the injury had been caused by a door.  He also gave evidence that he had not heard the appellant telling the complainant what she was to say.  At the hospital a doctor was told that the injuries were caused by the jamming of the fingers in a door.  The suggestion had also been made that the injury had been caused by a deliberate slamming of the door on the complainant.  That might involve an offence, but it was not consistent with the complainant's account.

 
	Reliance is also placed on the untruthfulness of the complainant's statement that she had not been drinking.  It is clear, and accepted on the evidence, that she must have been very substantially under the influence of alcohol at the time of the offence.  Her denial goes to her credibility; the influence of the drink on events is not said to be relevant.

 
	Further, following the detaining of the appellant, the complainant wrote him a number of letters in affectionate terms, in one of which she said, "All this crap should never have happened," the meaning of which is arguable, but does add weight, it is submitted, to the suggestion that her complaints had been manufactured.

 
	Clearly there would have been very substantial grounds for cross-examination of the complainant had she given evidence, because of her inconsistencies, lies and the other evidence to which we have referred.

 
	The prosecution rely on the medical evidence that, on a balance of probabilities, it was likely that the injury was caused by a machete, a slicing injury rather than a slamming injury.  That is consistent with the complainant's amount in the statements, though it is not conclusive evidence, the doctor accepting that the other possibility could not be excluded.  The prosecution also submit that the lie in relation to the taking of alcohol is not material to the issues which the judge had to consider.

 
	Mr Spackman submits that in his discretion the judge was entitled to admit the statements under the 2003 Act, having due regard to section 78 of the 1984 Act and to the statements of principle.  It should be stated that the case of Cole and Keet, on which Mr Spackman relies, was not available to the judge when he made his ruling on 3rd July 2007.

 
	It has been necessary to consider the facts of those cases and Al-Khawaja to establish the principles permitting the admission of the statements and their application to the current facts.

 
	We cannot accept the proposition that the presence of serious inconsistencies and lies in the statement of an absent witness necessarily operates in favour of its admission, because inconsistencies favour the defence.  On that approach the court is less likely to admit an apparently reliable statement than an apparently unreliable statement.  That conflicts with proposition (iv) in Sellick, cited by this court at paragraph 16 of Cole, and is contrary to section 114(2)(e) of the 2003 Act, which provides that the court must have regard to: "how reliable the maker of the statement appears to be". 

 
	That approach to inconsistencies and lies does emerge from the judge's ruling as cited, though other factors were also present.  It was not a correct approach in our judgment.  It may well have influenced his eventual ruling.  That enables this court to exercise its own discretion.

 
	We have considered the cases of Al-Khawaja, Cole and Keet and have thought it appropriate to refer to the facts in those cases in some detail.  In each of those cases the contents of the statements fit comfortably with other available evidence, which indeed provide substantial support for their accuracy.  That is not the situation in this case.  The medical evidence is consistent with the complaint made by the victim.  Much of the evidence, which we have summarised, gives rise to serious questions, and doubts, about the accuracy of the account contained in the statements admitted.

 
	We have come to the conclusion that the admission of the statements in this case, in a situation in which the maker of the statements could not be cross-examined, did in the circumstances deprive the appellant of a fair trial.  We have particular regard to section 114(2)(e), to which we have referred.  Of the other factors stated, some favour admission, others are neutral.  But there could not be a fair trial in this case, having regard to the very serious doubts about the reliability of the statement concerned, without the maker of the statement being available for cross-examination.

 
	The trial was not in that respect fair, and it follows that the verdict is, in our judgment, unsafe and the verdict must be quashed.  The appeal accordingly is allowed.

 
	Are there any applications?

 
	MR WALTERS:  None, my Lord, except the discharge of the appellant.

 
	LORD JUSTICE PILL:  Mr Spackman? 

 
	MR SPACKMAN:  No, thank you, my Lord.

 
	LORD JUSTICE PILL:  There are no other matters on which attention arises, so a discharge is appropriate? 

 
	MR SPACKMAN:  Yes, it is.

 
	LORD JUSTICE PILL:  Thank you very much.  We are grateful to both counsel for their submissions.
